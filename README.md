## To add somewhere

### Build
- Show how to build custom D3.js libraries by concatting stuff together.
- Write something about de packaging of D3.js
- Say we'll just reference the javascript stuff, and don't use commonjs / requirejs or something.
- Show that you can also reference them to CDNJS or npmCDN or from the d3.js site.
- Might add workflow to get in production by packaging vendor and common files

In our examples, we'll run them locally, which provides the best experience when developing.
