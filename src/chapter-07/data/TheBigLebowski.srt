1
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,127
Way out West
there was this fella.

2
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:46,546
Fella I wanna tell you about.

3
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:50,091
Fella by the name
of Jeff Lebowski.

4
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:53,803
Least that was the handle that
his loving parents gave him.

5
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,931
But he never had
much use for it himself.

6
00:00:57,015 --> 00:01:01,060
This Lebowski,
he called himself the Dude.

7
00:01:01,145 --> 00:01:03,229
Now Dude,

8
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:06,983
that's a name no one would
self-apply where I come from.

9
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:12,447
But then there was a lot about the Dude
that didn't make a whole lot of sense to me,

10
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:15,199
and a lot about
where he lived likewise.

11
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:19,120
But then again,

12
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:22,290
maybe that's why I found the
place so darned interesting.

13
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:31,424
They call Los Angeles
the City of Angels.

14
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:34,552
I didn't find it to be that,
exactly.

15
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:38,347
But I'll allow there are
some nice folks there.

16
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:41,100
Course, I can't say
I seen London,

17
00:01:41,185 --> 00:01:43,436
and I never been to France,

18
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,566
and I ain't never seen no queen in
her damned undies, as the fella says.

19
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,568
But I'll tell you what,

20
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:55,948
after seeing Los Angeles and this
here story I'm about to unfold,

21
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:58,868
well, I guess
I've seen something

22
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:03,122
every bit as stupefying as you can
see in any of those other places,

23
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:05,374
and in English, too.

24
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:08,377
So I can die with
a smile on my face

25
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:11,255
without feeling like
the good Lord gypped me.

26
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,300
Now, this here story
I'm about to unfold

27
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:17,386
took place back
in the early '90s,

28
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:22,308
just about the time of our
conflict with Saddam and the Iraqis.

29
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:25,978
I only mention it 'cause
sometimes there's a man...

30
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:28,105
I won't say a hero.

31
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,233
'Cause what's a hero?

32
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:32,652
But sometimes there's a man...

33
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:35,738
And I'm talking about
the Dude here.

34
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:38,491
Sometimes there's a man...

35
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:43,162
Well, he's the man
for his time and place.

36
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:45,998
He fits right in there.

37
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:49,460
And that's the Dude
in Los Angeles.

38
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:53,172
And even if he is a lazy man,

39
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:55,883
and the Dude was
most certainly that,

40
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:59,720
quite possibly the laziest
in Los Angeles county,

41
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:03,683
which would place him high in
the running for laziest worldwide.

42
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:07,728
But sometimes there's a man...

43
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:10,606
Sometimes there's a man...

44
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:15,486
Well, I lost my train
of thought here.

45
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:16,821
But...

46
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:20,157
Hell, I done introduced him
enough.

47
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:22,577
...with them all
for a collective action.

48
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,370
This will not stand.

49
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:27,957
This will not stand, this
aggression against Kuwait.

50
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,948
Where's the money,
Lebowski?

51
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:03,242
I want that money,
Lebowski.

52
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:05,786
Bunny says you're
good for it.

53
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:11,042
Where's the money,
Lebowski?

54
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:13,669
Where's the fucking money,
shithead?

55
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:18,883
It's down there somewhere.
Let me take another look.

56
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:21,552
Don't fuck with us.

57
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,806
Your wife owes money
to Jackie Treehorn,

58
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:28,768
that means you owe money
to Jackie Treehorn.

59
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:31,062
Ever thus to deadbeats,
Lebowski.

60
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,731
No, don't do...

61
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:38,152
Not on the rug, man.
See?

62
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:41,572
See what happens, Lebowski?
You see what happens?

63
00:04:41,657 --> 00:04:44,617
Nobody calls me Lebowski.
You got the wrong guy.

64
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,452
I'm the Dude, man.

65
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:49,288
Your name's Lebowski,
Lebowski.

66
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:51,165
Your wife is Bunny.

67
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:54,418
My wife? Bunny?

68
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:56,462
Do you see a wedding ring
on my finger?

69
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,839
Does this place look like
I'm fucking married?

70
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:01,092
The toilet seat's up, man!

71
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:11,018
What the fuck is this?

72
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:13,312
Obviously you're
not a golfer.

73
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:18,025
Woo?
Yeah.

74
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,778
Isn't this guy supposed
to be a millionaire?

75
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:23,364
Fuck.

76
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:26,575
Yeah. What do you think?

77
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,953
He looks like
a fucking loser.

78
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,789
Hey, at least I'm housebroken.

79
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,582
Fucking time-waster.

80
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,543
Thanks a lot,
asshole.

81
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,758
I'm throwing rocks tonight.
Mark it, Dude.

82
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:52,346
I'm telling you, this was
a valued rug. This was a...

83
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,974
Yeah, man. It really
tied the room together.

84
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:56,684
This was
a valued...

85
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,519
What tied the room
together, Dude? My rug.

86
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,104
Were you listening to
the Dude's story, Donny?

87
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,272
What?
Walter.

88
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:04,066
Were you listening to the
Dude's story? I was bowling.

89
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:06,402
So you have no frame of
reference here, Donny.

90
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,280
You're like a child who wanders into the
middle of a movie and wants to know...

91
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:12,825
Walter, what's the point, man? There's
no reason, here's my point, Dude.

92
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,535
There's no fucking reason
why these two...

93
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:15,786
Yeah, Walter,
what's your point?

94
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,872
Walter, what is the...

95
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:20,374
Look, we all know
who is at fault here.

96
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,668
What the fuck are you
talking about? Huh?

97
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,462
No, what the fuck
are you... I'm not...

98
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:28,340
We're talking about unchecked
aggression here, Dude.

99
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,092
What the fuck is he
talking about? My rug.

100
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:31,969
Forget it, Donny! You're
out of your element!

101
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,638
Walter, the Chinaman
who peed on my rug,

102
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:36,557
I can't go
give him a bill!

103
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,309
So what the fuck
are you talking about?

104
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:39,518
What the fuck are
you talking about?

105
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:41,729
The Chinaman is not
the issue here, Dude!

106
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:44,398
I'm talking about drawing
a line in the sand, Dude.

107
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:46,901
Across this line
you do not...

108
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:51,071
Also, Dude, "Chinaman" is not
the preferred nomenclature.

109
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:52,781
Asian-American,
please.

110
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:56,285
Walter, this isn't a guy who built
the railroads here. This is a guy...

111
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,995
What the fuck
are you...

112
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:01,123
Walter, he peed on my rug!
He peed on the Dude's rug.

113
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,750
Donny, you're out
of your element.

114
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:06,128
Dude, the Chinaman
is not the issue here.

115
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:08,631
So, who...
Jeff Lebowski.

116
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:11,842
The other Jeffrey Lebowski.
The millionaire.

117
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:14,678
That's fucking interesting,
man. That's fucking interesting.

118
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:18,724
Plus, he has the wealth,
obviously, and the resources,

119
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,352
so that there's no reason,
there's no fucking reason

120
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:24,146
why his wife should go out
and owe money all over town,

121
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:26,690
and then they come and they
pee on your fucking rug!

122
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:28,025
Am I wrong?
No.

123
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,652
Am I wrong?
Yeah, but...

124
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:30,778
Okay then.

125
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:35,616
That rug really tied the
room together, did it not?

126
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,618
Fucking A.
And this guy peed on it.

127
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,036
Donny, please.

128
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,287
You know, this is
the fucking guy...

129
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:42,665
I could find this
fucking Lebowski guy.

130
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:45,084
His name is Lebowski?
That's your name, Dude.

131
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:49,463
This is the guy who should
compensate me for the fucking rug.

132
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:53,175
His wife goes out and owes money all
over town, and they pee on my rug?

133
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,302
They pee on
your fucking rug?

134
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:58,097
Peed on my fucking rug.
That's right, Dude.

135
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:01,850
They peed on
your fucking rug.

136
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:05,145
This is the study.

137
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,815
As you can see, the various
commendations, awards...

138
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:11,819
"Jeffrey Lebowski. "... citations,
honorary degrees, et cetera.

139
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:15,572
Very impressive. Oh, please
feel free to inspect them.

140
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:18,284
Oh. No, I'm not really...
Oh, please. Please.

141
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:20,286
That is the key to
the city of Pasadena,

142
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:25,749
which Mr. Lebowski received two years
ago in recognition of his various civic...

143
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:30,504
Oh! That's the Los Angeles Chamber
of Commerce Business Achiever Award,

144
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,756
which is given... Oh, not
necessarily given every year.

145
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:33,924
Hey, is this...

146
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,259
Given only when there's
a worthy somebody...

147
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:36,635
Is this him with Nancy?

148
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,972
Yes, indeed, that is Mr.
Lebowski with the first lady, yes.

149
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,265
It was taken
when Mrs. Reagan...

150
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,976
That's Lebowski
on the left there?

151
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,812
Of course. Mr. Lebowski,
on the left... So he's a...

152
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,481
You know, a handicapped
kind of guy?

153
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,734
Mr. Lebowski is
disabled, yes.

154
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:55,571
This picture was taken when Mrs.
Reagan was first lady of the nation.

155
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,739
Yes, yes.

156
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,782
Not of California.
Good shot.

157
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:01,076
In fact, he met privately
with the President,

158
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:03,912
though, unfortunately, there wasn't
enough time for a photo opportunity.

159
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,956
Oh, Nancy's pretty good.
Oh, wonderful woman.

160
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:08,334
We were very happy to...
These are...

161
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:11,086
Oh, those are Mr. Lebowski's
children, so to speak.

162
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,421
Different mothers, huh?

163
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:14,840
No, they're not...
Racially, he's pretty cool?

164
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:18,385
They're not literally
his children.

165
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,721
They're the Little Lebowski
Urban Achievers,

166
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,849
inner city children of promise, but
without the necessary means for...

167
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,934
Necessary means for
a higher education,

168
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:29,438
so Mr. Lebowski is committed to
sending all of them to college.

169
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,856
Excuse me.
Oh, geez.

170
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,691
Thank you. Thank you.

171
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:37,279
Far out. Think he's got
room for one more? One... Oh.

172
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,157
You never went to college.

173
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:42,326
Please, don't touch that.
Oh, yeah, yeah. No, I did,

174
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,703
but, you know,
I spent most of my time

175
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:47,915
occupying various
administration buildings,

176
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:49,708
smoking a lot
of Thai stick,

177
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:53,045
breaking into the ROTC
and bowling.

178
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,381
Tell you the truth, Brandt,
I don't remember most of it.

179
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:04,348
Okay, sir. You're a
Lebowski, I'm a Lebowski.

180
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,183
That's terrific.

181
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:09,144
But I am very busy,
as I imagine you are.

182
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:11,897
What can I do for you, sir?

183
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:15,526
Well, sir,
it's this rug I have.

184
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,611
It really tied
the room together.

185
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:20,406
You told Brandt on
the phone. He told me.

186
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,990
Where do I fit in?

187
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:25,911
Well, they were looking
for you, these two guys.

188
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,955
You know, they...
I'll say it again.

189
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:31,166
You told Brandt on the phone.
He told me.

190
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,293
I know what happened.
Yes, yes.

191
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:36,588
Oh, so you know that they were
trying to piss on your rug.

192
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:38,882
Did I urinate on your rug?

193
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:41,218
You mean, did you personally
come and pee on my rug?

194
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,262
Hello! Do you speak
English, sir?

195
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:45,222
Parla usted ingl�s?

196
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:48,183
I'll ask you again.
Did I urinate on your rug?

197
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:51,603
No. Like I said,
Woo peed on my rug.

198
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:53,355
I just want to
understand this, sir.

199
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,359
Every time a rug is micturated
upon in this fair city,

200
00:12:57,444 --> 00:12:59,194
I have to compensate
the person?

201
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,489
Come on, man. I'm not
trying to scam anybody here.

202
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:04,408
You know, I'm just...

203
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:08,036
You're just looking for
a handout like every other...

204
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:11,665
Are you employed,
Mr. Lebowski?

205
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:15,085
Wait. Let me explain
something to you.

206
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:17,004
I am not Mr. Lebowski.

207
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:20,048
You're Mr. Lebowski.
I'm the Dude.

208
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:22,634
So that's what you call me.
You know?

209
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,803
That or His Dudeness,

210
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:27,347
or Duder or, you know,

211
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:30,476
El Duderino, if you're not
into the whole brevity thing.

212
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,561
Are you employed, sir?

213
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,230
Employed?

214
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:41,153
You don't go out looking for a job
dressed like that, do you? On a weekday?

215
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,613
Is this a...

216
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:45,824
What day is this?
Well, I do work, sir.

217
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:50,078
So, if you don't mind... No,
I do mind. The Dude minds.

218
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,914
This will not stand, you know.

219
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:54,500
This aggression
will not stand, man.

220
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:56,335
I mean,
your wife owes money...

221
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:59,379
My wife is not
the issue here!

222
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:02,841
I hope that someday my wife will
learn to live on her allowance,

223
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:04,343
which is ample.

224
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:07,262
But if she does not, that
is her problem, not mine,

225
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:08,972
just as the rug
is your problem.

226
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:13,018
Just as every bum's lot in
life is his own responsibility,

227
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,812
regardless of who
he chooses to blame.

228
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:18,982
I didn't blame anyone
for the loss of my legs.

229
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:21,527
Some Chinaman took them
from me in Korea.

230
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:24,029
But I went out
and achieved anyway.

231
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:28,492
I cannot solve your
problems, sir. Only you can.

232
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,038
Well, fuck it.
Oh, fuck it.

233
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:36,208
Yes, that's your answer. That's
your answer to everything.

234
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,043
Tattoo it on your forehead!

235
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,587
Your revolution is over,
Mr. Lebowski!

236
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:43,924
Condolences! The bums lost!

237
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:47,219
My advice to you is to do
what your parents did!

238
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,096
Get a job, sir!

239
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,723
The bums will
always lose!

240
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,559
Do you hear me,
Lebowski?

241
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:56,061
The bums will
always lose.

242
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,606
How was your meeting,
Mr. Lebowski?

243
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:01,191
Okay.

244
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:03,777
The old man told me to take
any rug in the house.

245
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,113
Well, enjoy.

246
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:08,740
And perhaps we'll see you
again sometime, Dude.

247
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:09,950
Yeah, sure.

248
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:12,911
If I'm in the neighborhood,
you know,

249
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:16,582
and I need to use the john.

250
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:29,386
Blow on them.
Huh?

251
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:31,722
Go ahead. Blow.

252
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:36,852
You want me to blow
on your toes?

253
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:38,520
Uh-huh.

254
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:41,023
I can't blow that far.

255
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:49,281
Are you sure he won't mind?

256
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:52,451
Uli doesn't care about
anything. He's a nihilist.

257
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:54,786
Oh, that must be exhausting.

258
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:56,622
You're not blowing.

259
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:59,458
Our guest has to be getting
along, Mrs. Lebowski.

260
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:00,959
Oh!

261
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:02,919
You're Bunny.

262
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,381
I'll suck your cock
for $1,000.

263
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,721
Wonderful woman.

264
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,931
We're all very fond of her.
Very free-spirited.

265
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:17,726
Brandt can't watch though,
or he has to pay $100.

266
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,896
That's marvelous.

267
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:25,901
I'm just gonna go
find a cash machine.

268
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,574
I'm slamming them tonight!

269
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:34,951
You guys are dead
in the water.

270
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:37,996
All right!
Way to go, Donny!

271
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,416
"If you will it,
it is no dream. "

272
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:44,920
Fucking 20 minutes late, man.
What the fuck is that?

273
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,005
Theodore Herzl.
Huh?

274
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:50,175
State of Israel. If you will
it, Dude, it is no dream.

275
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,135
What the fuck are you
talking about, man?

276
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:55,097
The carrier. What's in
the fucking carrier? Huh?

277
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:58,141
Oh! Cynthia's dog.
Think it's a Pomeranian.

278
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:00,227
Can't leave him home alone
or he eats the furniture.

279
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:03,063
I'm watching it while Cynthia
and Marty Ackerman are in Hawaii.

280
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,065
You brought a fucking
Pomeranian bowling?

281
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:06,692
What do you mean,
brought it bowling?

282
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:09,778
I didn't rent it shoes. I'm
not buying it a fucking beer.

283
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,947
He's not taking your
fucking turn, Dude.

284
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:15,367
Man, if my fucking ex-wife asked
me to take care of her fucking dog

285
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,202
while she and her boyfriend
went to Honolulu,

286
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,871
I'd tell her to go fuck
herself. Why can't she board it?

287
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:21,790
First of all, Dude,
you don't have an ex.

288
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:25,043
Secondly, this is a fucking
show dog with fucking papers.

289
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:27,838
You can't board it. It gets
upset. Its hair falls out.

290
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:30,257
Walter... Fucking dog
has fucking papers.

291
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:33,009
Over the line!
Huh?

292
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:35,429
I'm sorry, Smokey. You were
over the line. That's a foul.

293
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:37,180
Bullshit. Mark it eight, Dude.

294
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:40,392
Excuse me. Mark it zero.
Next frame.

295
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:43,395
Bullshit, Walter.
Mark it eight, Dude.

296
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:46,064
Smokey, this is not Nam. This
is bowling. There are rules.

297
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:48,900
Hey, Walter, come on.
Hey, man, it's Smokey.

298
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:51,153
So his toe slipped over
a little, you know.

299
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,405
It's just a game, man.
This is a league game.

300
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,407
This determines who enters
the next round robin.

301
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,242
Am I wrong?
Yeah, but I wasn't...

302
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,870
Am I wrong?
Yeah, but I wasn't over.

303
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:02,664
Give me the marker, Dude.
I'm marking an eight.

304
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:04,499
Smokey, my friend,

305
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:08,295
you're entering a world
of pain. Walter, man.

306
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:12,090
You mark that frame an eight,
you're entering a world of pain.

307
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:14,760
I'm not...
A world of pain.

308
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:16,928
Look, Dude,
this is your partner.

309
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:19,389
Has the whole world
gone crazy?

310
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:22,225
Am I the only one around here
who gives a shit about the rules?

311
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,560
Mark it zero!

312
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,729
They're calling the cops, man.
Put the piece away.

313
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:28,899
Mark it zero! Walter,
put the piece away.

314
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:31,193
Walter. You think I'm
fucking around here?

315
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:32,903
Mark it zero!

316
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:41,953
All right. It's fucking zero.

317
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:44,122
You happy,
you crazy fuck?

318
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:48,502
It's a league game,
Smokey.

319
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:51,880
You can't do that, man.

320
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,674
These guys, you know, they're
like me, they're pacifists.

321
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:57,344
Smokey was a
conscientious objector.

322
00:18:57,428 --> 00:19:00,263
You know, Dude, I myself
dabbled in pacifism at one point.

323
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:01,640
Not in Nam, of course.

324
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:05,185
And you know he's got
emotional problems, man.

325
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,687
You mean, beyond pacifism?

326
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:10,482
He's fragile.
He's very fragile.

327
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:15,070
I did not know that.

328
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:18,031
Well, it's all water
under the bridge.

329
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:21,117
And we do enter
the next round robin.

330
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:23,495
Am I wrong?
No, you're not wrong.

331
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,330
Am I wrong?
You're not wrong, Walter.

332
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:26,790
You're just an asshole.

333
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,333
Okay then.

334
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,043
Play Quintana and
O'Brien next week.

335
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,045
They should be pushovers.

336
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,674
Man, would you just...

337
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:37,509
Just take it easy, man.

338
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,886
You know, that's your answer
for everything, Dude.

339
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:42,848
Let me point out something.
Pacifism is not...

340
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:45,767
Look at our current situation
with that camel fucker in Iraq.

341
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:47,811
Pacifism is not something
to hide behind.

342
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,272
Just take it easy, man.

343
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:52,732
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.

344
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:56,278
Yeah, waving the fucking gun
around? Calmer than you are.

345
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,280
Will you just take it easy?

346
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:00,907
Calmer than you are.

347
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:06,872
Dude, this is Smokey.

348
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:08,874
Look, I don't wanna be
a hard-on about this,

349
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,208
and I know
it wasn't your fault,

350
00:20:10,293 --> 00:20:11,877
but I just thought
it was fair to tell you

351
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:14,170
that Gilbert and I will be
submitting this to the league

352
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:16,464
and asking them
to set aside the round.

353
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:19,217
I don't know,
maybe forfeit it to us.

354
00:20:19,302 --> 00:20:22,554
So, like I say, just thought,
you know, fair warning.

355
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,097
Tell Walter.

356
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:25,432
I'm sorry.

357
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,644
Mr. Lebowski,
this is Brandt at...

358
00:20:31,314 --> 00:20:33,189
Well, at Mr. Lebowski's
office.

359
00:20:33,274 --> 00:20:35,775
Please call us
as soon as it's convenient.

360
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:39,571
Mr. Lebowski,
this is Mel Zelnicker

361
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,114
of the Southern Cal
Bowling League.

362
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:46,453
I just got an informal report that a
member of your team, a Walter Sobchak,

363
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:48,788
drew a firearm
during league play.

364
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:50,457
If this is true, of course,

365
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,250
it contravenes a number of
the league's bylaws

366
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:54,044
and also article 27
of the league...

367
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,797
Dude.
Hey, Marty.

368
00:20:57,882 --> 00:20:59,633
Dude, I finally got...

369
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:02,010
I got the venue I wanted.

370
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:06,014
I'm performing my dance
quintet, you know, my cycle,

371
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,850
at Crane Jackson's Fountain
Street Theater on Tuesday night.

372
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:13,188
And, well, I'd love it if
you came and gave me notes.

373
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:15,732
I'll be there, man.

374
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:20,904
Dude, tomorrow's
already the tenth.

375
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,531
Far out.

376
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,328
Oh. Oh, all right. Okay.

377
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:31,206
Just slip the rent
under my door.

378
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:37,420
...serious infraction
and examine your standing.

379
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:39,005
Thank you.

380
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:43,218
Mr. Lebowski, Brandt again.

381
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:46,721
Please do call us as soon as you
get in and I'll send the limo.

382
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:50,392
I hope you're not avoiding
this call because of the rug,

383
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:53,144
which I assure you
is not a problem.

384
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:55,855
We need your help, and...

385
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:59,901
Well, we would very much like to
see you. Thank you. It's Brandt.

386
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:02,696
We've had some
terrible news.

387
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,990
Mr. Lebowski's in seclusion
in the west wing.

388
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:10,954
Mr. Lebowski.

389
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,212
Funny.

390
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:24,217
I can look back on
a life of achievement,

391
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:26,511
challenges met,

392
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,638
competitors bested,

393
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:30,432
obstacles overcome.

394
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:35,395
I've accomplished
more than most men

395
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:37,772
and without
the use of my legs.

396
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:45,238
What makes a man,
Mr. Lebowski?

397
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:47,949
Dude.
Huh?

398
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:52,662
Oh, I don't know, sir.

399
00:22:52,747 --> 00:22:55,623
Is it being prepared
to do the right thing,

400
00:22:57,752 --> 00:22:59,419
whatever the cost?

401
00:23:00,254 --> 00:23:02,380
Isn't that what
makes a man?

402
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:06,009
Sure, that and
a pair of testicles.

403
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:08,386
You're joking,

404
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,265
but perhaps you're right.

405
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:14,267
You mind if I do a Jay?

406
00:23:16,187 --> 00:23:17,353
Bunny.

407
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,774
Excuse me?

408
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:22,650
Bunny Lebowski.

409
00:23:23,778 --> 00:23:25,904
She is the light of my life.

410
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:29,991
Are you surprised
at my tears, sir?

411
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:33,787
Oh, fucking A.

412
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:41,002
Strong men also cry.

413
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:46,508
I received
this fax this morning.

414
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:53,098
As you can see,
it is a ransom note.

415
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:56,101
"We have Bunny. "

416
00:23:56,185 --> 00:24:00,438
Written by men who were unable to
achieve on a level field of play.

417
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:03,149
"Gather $1 million... "

418
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:06,653
Cowards! "... in unmarked,
nonconsecutive 20s. "

419
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:09,447
Weaklings!
"Await instructions. "

420
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:11,324
Bums!
"No funny stuff. "

421
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:14,577
Bummer.
Huh?

422
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:19,541
This is a bummer, man.
That's... That's a bummer.

423
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:23,044
Brandt will fill you in
on the details.

424
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:42,355
Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a
generous offer to you to act as courier

425
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,983
once we get instructions
for the money.

426
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:46,234
Why me, man?

427
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:51,823
He believes the culprits might be
the very people who soiled your rug

428
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:56,828
and you are in a unique position to
confirm or disconfirm that suspicion.

429
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:58,663
He thinks the carpet pissers
did this?

430
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,665
Well, Dude,
we just don't know.

431
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:39,764
Fucking Quintana.

432
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:43,059
That creep can roll, man.

433
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:46,187
Yeah, but he's a pervert, Dude. Yeah.

434
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:50,066
No, he's a sex offender
with a record.

435
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:53,111
He did six months in Chino for
exposing himself to an eight-year-old.

436
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,489
When he moved to Hollywood,
he had to go door-to-door

437
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:58,366
to tell everyone
he was a pederast.

438
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:02,829
What's a pederast, Walter?
Shut the fuck up, Donny.

439
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:07,750
So, how much
did he give you?

440
00:27:07,835 --> 00:27:11,087
20 grand, man. And, of course,
I still get to keep the rug.

441
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:12,547
Just for making a hand-off? Yeah.

442
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:15,008
They gave Dude a beeper.

443
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:18,803
So whenever these guys call...
What if it's during a game?

444
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:21,514
Oh, I told them if it
was during league play...

445
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:22,724
What's during
league play?

446
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:25,268
Life does not stop and
start at your convenience,

447
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:27,270
you miserable
piece of shit.

448
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,314
I figure... What's
wrong with Walter, Dude?

449
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:31,899
I figure it's easy money, you
know. It's all pretty harmless.

450
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:33,818
She probably
kidnapped herself.

451
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:37,655
What do you mean, Dude?
Rug-peers did not do this.

452
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:42,618
Look at it. A young trophy wife
marries this guy for his money.

453
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:45,538
She figures he isn't
giving her enough, you know.

454
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:47,373
She owes money
all over town.

455
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:49,625
That fucking bitch!

456
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,502
It's all a goddamn
fake, man.

457
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:53,504
It's like Lenin said,

458
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:58,551
you look for the person who
will benefit and, you know...

459
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:01,262
I Am the Walrus?
You know, you'll...

460
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,931
You know what I'm trying
to say. I Am the Walrus.

461
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:06,809
That fucking bitch!
Oh, yeah!

462
00:28:06,894 --> 00:28:08,311
I Am the Walrus.
That's...

463
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:09,896
Shut the fuck up,
Donny!

464
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:13,024
V. I. Lenin, Vladimir
llyich Ulyanov!

465
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,275
What the fuck is
he talking about?

466
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,194
Fucking exactly what
happened to those...

467
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:17,820
That makes me
fucking sick!

468
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:20,865
Well, what do you care,
Walter? Those rich fucks.

469
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:22,909
This whole fucking thing.

470
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:25,745
I did not watch my buddies
die face down in the muck

471
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:27,580
so that this
fucking strumpet,

472
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:28,831
this fucking whore,
could waltz around...

473
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:31,334
I don't see any connection
with Vietnam, man.

474
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:33,044
Well, there isn't a
literal connection, Dude.

475
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:35,046
No, Walter, face it,
there isn't any connection.

476
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,589
Your roll.
Have it your way.

477
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:38,007
Your roll.
But my point is...

478
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:40,885
My point is...
Are you ready to be fucked, man?

479
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:45,348
I see you rolled your way
into the semis.

480
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:48,726
Dios m�o, man.

481
00:28:48,811 --> 00:28:51,646
Liam and me,
we're gonna fuck you up.

482
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:57,944
Yeah? Well, you know, that's
just like your opinion, man.

483
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:02,240
Let me tell you
something, pendejo.

484
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:04,534
You pull any of your
crazy shit with us,

485
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:07,412
you flash a piece out
on the lanes,

486
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:10,415
I'll take it away from you
and stick it up your ass

487
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:13,709
and pull the fucking trigger
till it goes click.

488
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:16,921
Jesus.

489
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:18,673
You said it, man.

490
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:21,008
Nobody fucks with the Jesus.

491
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:28,683
Eight-year-olds, Dude.

492
00:31:33,183 --> 00:31:34,684
They called
about 80 minutes ago.

493
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:37,395
They want you to take the
money, drive north on the 405.

494
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:38,813
They will call you
on the portable phone

495
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,982
with instructions
in about 40 minutes.

496
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:42,149
One person only.

497
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:44,652
They were very clear on that, or
I'd go with you. One person only.

498
00:31:44,778 --> 00:31:47,780
What happened to your
jaw? Oh, nothing, man.

499
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:50,950
Here's the money.

500
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:53,411
And the phone.

501
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:56,330
Please, Dude, follow whatever
instructions they give.

502
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:59,208
All right.
Her life is in your hands.

503
00:31:59,293 --> 00:32:00,918
Man, don't say that.

504
00:32:01,003 --> 00:32:03,588
Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat
that, her life is in your hands.

505
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:05,006
Oh, shit, man.

506
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,425
Her life is in
your hands, Dude.

507
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:10,177
Report back to us
as soon as it's done.

508
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:23,941
Where the fuck are you going,
man? Take the ringer, I'll drive.

509
00:32:24,026 --> 00:32:26,235
The what?
The ringer.

510
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,945
The ringer, Dude.

511
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:37,663
What the...
Have they called yet?

512
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:39,540
What the hell is this?

513
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:42,501
My dirty undies, Dude.
The laundry. The whites.

514
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:46,714
Walter, I'm sure there's a reason
you brought your dirty undies, man.

515
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,090
That's right, Dude.
The weight.

516
00:32:48,175 --> 00:32:49,467
The ringer cannot look empty.

517
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:51,636
Walter, what the fuck
are you thinking, man?

518
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,638
You're right, Dude.
I got to thinking.

519
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:56,557
I got to thinking, why should we
settle for a measly fucking 20 grand...

520
00:32:56,642 --> 00:32:59,852
We? What the fuck, "we"? You said
you just wanted to come along.

521
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:02,313
My point, Dude, is why
should we settle for 20 grand

522
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:05,066
when we can keep the
entire million? Am I wrong?

523
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:08,235
Yes, you're wrong. This
isn't a fucking game, man.

524
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,655
Oh, but it is a game.
You said so yourself.

525
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:12,948
She kidnapped herself.
I said I thought...

526
00:33:19,206 --> 00:33:21,248
Dude, here.
Who is this?

527
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:25,628
Dude. The bagman, man.
Where do you want us to go?

528
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:26,754
Us?

529
00:33:28,382 --> 00:33:29,465
Shit!

530
00:33:31,385 --> 00:33:34,011
Yeah, you know,
me and the driver.

531
00:33:34,096 --> 00:33:37,848
I'm not handling the money, driving the
car and talking on the phone all by my...

532
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:39,183
Shut the fuck up!

533
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:42,269
Dude, are you fucking
this up? Who is that?

534
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:46,190
That is the driver.
I told you...

535
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:49,860
Oh, shit!
What the fuck's going on?

536
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:51,320
Walter...
What the fuck is going on?

537
00:33:51,405 --> 00:33:55,700
He hung up, man. You fucked
it up. You fucked it up!

538
00:33:55,826 --> 00:33:58,369
Her life was in our
hands, man. Easy, Dude.

539
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:02,331
We're screwed now. We don't get
shit. They're gonna kill her.

540
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:05,126
We're fucked, Walter.
Nothing is fucked, Dude.

541
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,712
Come on.
You're being very un-Dude.

542
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:10,214
They'll call back.
Look, she kidnapped...

543
00:34:11,425 --> 00:34:13,384
You see? Nothing's
fucked here, Dude.

544
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:17,346
Nothing is fucked. They're
a bunch of fucking amateurs.

545
00:34:17,431 --> 00:34:19,932
Walter, will you just
shut the fuck up?

546
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:22,393
Don't say peep while
I'm doing business here, man.

547
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:24,437
Okay, Dude.
Have it your way.

548
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:28,983
But they're amateurs.
Fuck.

549
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:31,736
Dude.

550
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:35,072
Okay, we proceed but only
if there is no funny stuff.

551
00:34:35,157 --> 00:34:36,699
Yeah, yeah.

552
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,868
So no funny stuff. Okay?

553
00:34:38,952 --> 00:34:41,537
Just tell me where the fuck
you want us to go.

554
00:34:45,167 --> 00:34:47,376
That was the sign, man.

555
00:34:47,461 --> 00:34:51,172
So, all we gotta do
is get her back.

556
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:53,632
No one's in a position
to complain.

557
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:56,135
We keep the baksheesh.
Yeah, terrific, Walter.

558
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,888
But you haven't told me how we're
gonna get her back. Where is she?

559
00:34:58,972 --> 00:35:00,806
That's the simple part, Dude.

560
00:35:00,891 --> 00:35:05,186
We make the hand-off, I grab one
of them and beat it out of him. Huh?

561
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:08,939
That's a great plan, Walter.

562
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:11,150
That's fucking ingenious,
if I understand it correctly.

563
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:13,194
It's a Swiss fucking watch.

564
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:16,405
That's right, Dude. The beauty
of this is its simplicity.

565
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:19,742
Once a plan gets too complex,
everything can go wrong.

566
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:21,577
If there's one thing
I learned in Nam...

567
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,624
Dude.

568
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:28,542
You are coming
to wooden bridge.

569
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:29,794
When you cross the bridge,

570
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:33,172
you throw the bag from the
left window of the moving car.

571
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:34,298
You're being watched.

572
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:37,968
Fuck. What'd he say?
Where's the hand-off?

573
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:39,720
There is no fucking
hand-off, man.

574
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:42,473
At the wooden bridge we throw
the money out of the car.

575
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:45,392
We throw the money
out of the moving car.

576
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:48,604
We can't do that, Dude.
That fucks up our plan.

577
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,606
Well, call them up and
explain it to them, Walter.

578
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:51,941
Your plan is so
fucking simple,

579
00:35:52,025 --> 00:35:53,818
I'm sure they'll
fucking understand it.

580
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:55,027
That's the beauty of it.

581
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,530
Wooden bridge, huh? Throw
them the money, Walter.

582
00:35:57,614 --> 00:35:59,156
We're not fucking around, man.

583
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:01,492
Okay, Dude, the bridge is coming
up. Give me the ringer, chop-chop.

584
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:03,118
Fuck that.
Walter, I love you,

585
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:06,288
but sooner or later you're gonna have
to face the fact you're a goddamn moron.

586
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:08,707
Okay, Dude. No time to argue.
Hey, man!

587
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:11,168
Here's the bridge.
Hey, Walter! Hey, Walter!

588
00:36:11,253 --> 00:36:13,963
Hey, Walter!
Here goes the ringer!

589
00:36:15,257 --> 00:36:17,466
What the fuck?
Okay, Dude, you're wheel.

590
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:19,718
Hey, man, what the fuck?
At 15 mph, I roll out.

591
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:21,720
I double back, grab one of
them and beat it out of him.

592
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:23,013
The Uzi.
Uzi.

593
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:25,182
You didn't think I was rolling
out of here naked, did you?

594
00:36:25,267 --> 00:36:27,893
Walter, please! Fifteen, Dude!
This is it! Let's take that hill!

595
00:36:27,978 --> 00:36:29,270
Walter!

596
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:59,425
We have it!

597
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:15,983
Fuck it, Dude.

598
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,651
Let's go bowling.

599
00:37:56,149 --> 00:37:59,443
Aitz chaim he, Dude,
as the ex used to say.

600
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,320
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

601
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:04,490
What the fuck are we
gonna tell Lebowski?

602
00:38:04,574 --> 00:38:06,700
Oh, him.

603
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:09,787
I don't know. What
exactly is the problem?

604
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:11,705
The problem is...

605
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,750
What do you mean,
what's the...

606
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:16,377
There was no...

607
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:18,796
We didn't...

608
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:22,091
They're gonna kill
that poor woman, man!

609
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:24,009
What the fuck
are you talking about?

610
00:38:24,094 --> 00:38:26,637
The poor woman, that poor
slut kidnapped herself.

611
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:28,013
Come on, Dude.
You said so yourself.

612
00:38:28,098 --> 00:38:30,391
Man, I said I thought
she kidnapped herself.

613
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:31,976
You're the one who's
so fucking certain.

614
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:34,603
That's right, Dude.
100% certain.

615
00:38:34,688 --> 00:38:36,397
They posted the next round
for the tournament.

616
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:37,731
Donny, shut the fuck...

617
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:39,817
When do we play?
This Saturday. Quintana and...

618
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:41,652
Saturday? Well, they'll
have to reschedule.

619
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:44,071
Walter, what am I
gonna tell Lebowski?

620
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:47,491
I told that fuck down at the league
office. Who's in charge of scheduling?

621
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:49,118
Walter!
Burkhalter.

622
00:38:49,202 --> 00:38:52,162
I told that kraut a fucking thousand
times, I don't roll on shabbos!

623
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:53,539
Walter!
They already posted it.

624
00:38:53,623 --> 00:38:55,207
Well, they can
fucking un-post it!

625
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:58,585
Who gives a shit? They're
gonna kill that poor woman, man!

626
00:38:58,712 --> 00:39:00,963
What am I gonna tell
Lebowski? Come on, Dude.

627
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:04,049
Eventually she'll get tired of her
little game and, you know, wander on back.

628
00:39:04,134 --> 00:39:05,676
How come you don't roll
on Saturday, Walter?

629
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,885
I'm shomer shabbos.

630
00:39:07,012 --> 00:39:08,929
What's that, Walter?
Yeah, and in the meantime,

631
00:39:09,014 --> 00:39:10,431
what do I tell Lebowski?

632
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:12,850
Saturday, Donny, is shabbos,
the Jewish day of rest.

633
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:15,394
That means I don't work,
I don't drive a car,

634
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:16,979
I don't fucking
ride in a car,

635
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:18,897
I don't handle money,
I don't turn on the oven

636
00:39:18,982 --> 00:39:21,108
and I sure as shit
don't fucking roll!

637
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:23,110
Sheesh.

638
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,737
Shomer shabbos!

639
00:39:26,656 --> 00:39:29,324
Walter, how am I gonna...
Shomer fucking shabbos!

640
00:39:29,451 --> 00:39:32,703
Oh, fuck! That's it. I'm out
of here. Oh, come on, Dude.

641
00:39:34,748 --> 00:39:36,623
Dude! Dude!

642
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:40,210
You just tell him...

643
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:42,671
Tell him we made the drop and
everything went, you know...

644
00:39:42,756 --> 00:39:43,797
Oh, yeah.
How'd it go?

645
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:45,758
Went all right. Dude's
car got a little dinged up.

646
00:39:45,842 --> 00:39:48,218
Walter, we didn't make
the fucking hand-off, man!

647
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:50,387
They didn't get
the fucking money!

648
00:39:50,472 --> 00:39:51,680
And they're gonna...
They're gonna...

649
00:39:51,765 --> 00:39:53,348
They're gonna kill
that poor woman.

650
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:56,101
They're gonna kill
that poor woman!

651
00:39:56,186 --> 00:39:57,644
Walter, if you can't
ride in a car,

652
00:39:57,729 --> 00:39:59,104
then how do you get
around on shabbos?

653
00:39:59,189 --> 00:40:01,231
Really, Dude,
you surprise me.

654
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:02,608
They're not gonna
kill shit.

655
00:40:02,692 --> 00:40:03,817
They're not gonna do shit.

656
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:05,527
What can they do to her?
Bunch of fucking amateurs.

657
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:07,446
And meanwhile,
look at the bottom line.

658
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,782
Who's sitting on a million
fucking dollars?

659
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:10,991
Am I wrong?
Walter.

660
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:14,119
Who's got a fucking million fucking
dollars sitting in the trunk of our car?

661
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:17,247
Our car, Walter? And what
do they got? My dirty undies.

662
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:18,999
My fucking whites!

663
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,423
Say, Dude?

664
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,218
Where is your car?

665
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:32,471
Who's got your undies,
Walter? Where's your car, Dude?

666
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:34,681
You don't know,
Walter?

667
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:39,061
It was parked in a handicap
zone. Perhaps they towed it.

668
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:42,689
You fucking know
it's been stolen.

669
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:45,692
Well, certainly that's
a possibility, Dude.

670
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:48,487
Oh, fuck it.

671
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:54,451
Where you going, Dude?
I'm going home, Donny.

672
00:40:54,536 --> 00:40:57,704
Phone's ringing, Dude.
Thank you, Donny!

673
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:14,513
Yeah.

674
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:21,019
Green with some brown,
rust coloration.

675
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:25,357
And was there anything
of value in the car?

676
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:26,900
Oh, yeah.

677
00:41:28,278 --> 00:41:32,614
A tape deck, some Creedence
tapes, and there was a...

678
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:36,743
My briefcase.

679
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,956
In the briefcase?

680
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:44,251
Papers.

681
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:46,587
Just papers.

682
00:41:47,589 --> 00:41:50,966
You know, my papers,
business papers.

683
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:55,971
And what do you do, sir?
I'm unemployed.

684
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:02,269
My rug was also stolen.

685
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:04,646
Your rug was in the car?

686
00:42:04,731 --> 00:42:06,440
No. Here.

687
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:08,775
Separate incidents.

688
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:12,529
The Dude is not in.

689
00:42:12,614 --> 00:42:15,449
Do you find them much,
these stolen cars?

690
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:17,868
Sometimes.

691
00:42:18,703 --> 00:42:21,163
Wouldn't hold out much hope
for the tape deck though.

692
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:22,956
Or the Creedence.

693
00:42:23,124 --> 00:42:27,085
What about the briefcase?

694
00:42:27,629 --> 00:42:29,046
Mr. Lebowski,
I'd like to see you.

695
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:31,048
Call when you get home
and I'll send a car for you.

696
00:42:31,132 --> 00:42:34,760
My name is Maude Lebowski.
I'm the one who took your rug.

697
00:42:34,844 --> 00:42:37,930
Well, guess we can close
the file on that one.

698
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:32,442
I'll be with you in
a moment, Mr. Lebowski.

699
00:43:50,962 --> 00:43:54,381
Does the female form make you
uncomfortable, Mr. Lebowski?

700
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:58,260
Is that what this is a
picture of? In a sense, yes.

701
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:01,013
My art has been commended
as being strongly vaginal,

702
00:44:01,097 --> 00:44:02,180
which bothers some men.

703
00:44:02,265 --> 00:44:05,225
The word itself makes
some men uncomfortable.

704
00:44:05,727 --> 00:44:07,811
Vagina.
Oh, yeah?

705
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:10,314
Yes, they don't like hearing
it and find it difficult to say,

706
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:11,773
whereas without
batting an eye,

707
00:44:11,858 --> 00:44:16,069
a man will refer to his dick,
or his rod or his johnson.

708
00:44:17,322 --> 00:44:18,322
"Johnson"?

709
00:44:18,406 --> 00:44:21,116
All right, Mr. Lebowski,
let's get down to cases.

710
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,660
My father told me he agreed
to let you have the rug,

711
00:44:23,745 --> 00:44:27,706
but as it was a gift from me to my
late mother, it was not his to give.

712
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,708
Now, your face.

713
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,878
As for this kidnapping.

714
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:34,004
Huh?

715
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:37,507
Yes, I know all about it, and I
know that you acted as courier.

716
00:44:37,592 --> 00:44:40,844
Let me tell you something. The
whole thing stinks to high heaven.

717
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:45,140
Yeah, right, but let me
explain something about the rug.

718
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:47,434
Do you like sex,
Mr. Lebowski?

719
00:44:48,436 --> 00:44:51,688
Excuse me? Sex, the
physical act of love. Coitus.

720
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:55,025
Do you like it? I was
talking about my rug.

721
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:57,652
You're not interested in sex?

722
00:44:57,737 --> 00:45:00,030
You mean coitus?
I like it, too.

723
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:02,366
It's a male myth about
feminists that we hate sex.

724
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:04,868
It can be a natural,
zesty enterprise.

725
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:06,370
However, there are
some people,

726
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:09,373
it is called satyriasis in
men, nymphomania in women,

727
00:45:09,457 --> 00:45:12,626
who engage in it compulsively
and without joy.

728
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:15,712
Oh, no.
Oh, yes, Mr. Lebowski.

729
00:45:15,797 --> 00:45:19,716
These unfortunate souls cannot
love, in the true sense of the word.

730
00:45:19,801 --> 00:45:23,261
Our mutual acquaintance,
Bunny, is one of these.

731
00:45:23,346 --> 00:45:25,555
Listen, Maude,

732
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:28,850
I'm sorry if your stepmother
is a nympho,

733
00:45:28,935 --> 00:45:32,312
but, you know, I don't see
what this has to do with...

734
00:45:32,397 --> 00:45:35,190
You have any Kahlua?
Take a look at this, sir.

735
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:40,570
Oh, I know that guy.

736
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:44,366
He's a nihilist.

737
00:45:45,952 --> 00:45:47,661
"Karl Hungus. "

738
00:46:01,426 --> 00:46:02,843
Hi.
Hello.

739
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:05,887
Mein dispatcher says there is
something wrong with dein Kabel.

740
00:46:05,972 --> 00:46:07,097
Yeah. Come on in.

741
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:09,599
I'm not really sure exactly
what's really wrong with the cable.

742
00:46:09,684 --> 00:46:12,269
That's why they sent me.
I am an expert.

743
00:46:12,353 --> 00:46:13,687
The TV's in here.

744
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:16,940
You recognize her, of
course. Helga, bring my tools.

745
00:46:19,861 --> 00:46:21,611
That's my friend Sherry.

746
00:46:21,696 --> 00:46:23,363
She just came over
to use the shower.

747
00:46:23,448 --> 00:46:25,782
The story is ludicrous.

748
00:46:25,867 --> 00:46:28,827
My name is Karl.
Ich bin expert.

749
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:30,954
You must be here
to fix the cable.

750
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:33,915
Lord, you can imagine
where it goes from here.

751
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,459
He fixes the cable?

752
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:37,586
Don't be fatuous, Jeffrey.

753
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:40,964
Little matter to me that this woman
chose to pursue a career in pornography,

754
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:43,675
nor that she has been
banging Jackie Treehorn,

755
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:45,510
to use the parlance
of our times.

756
00:46:45,595 --> 00:46:49,556
However, I am one of the two
trustees of the Lebowski Foundation,

757
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,308
the other being my father.

758
00:46:51,392 --> 00:46:53,351
The foundation takes
youngsters from Watts and...

759
00:46:53,436 --> 00:46:54,811
Shit, yeah. The achievers.

760
00:46:54,896 --> 00:46:58,607
Little Lebowski Urban Achievers,
yes, and proud we are of all of them.

761
00:46:58,691 --> 00:47:02,527
I asked my father about his withdrawal
of $1 million from the foundation account,

762
00:47:02,612 --> 00:47:04,446
and he told me
about this abduction,

763
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:06,156
but I tell you
it is preposterous.

764
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:10,160
This compulsive fornicator is taking
my father for the proverbial ride.

765
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:12,162
Yeah, but my...
I'm getting to your rug.

766
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:13,997
My father and I
don't get along.

767
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:15,707
He doesn't approve
of my lifestyle and,

768
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:17,459
needless to say,
I don't approve of his.

769
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:21,338
However, I hardly wish to make my
father's embezzlement a police matter.

770
00:47:21,422 --> 00:47:24,299
So I'm proposing that you
try to recover the money

771
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:26,510
from the people
you delivered it to.

772
00:47:26,594 --> 00:47:29,513
Well, I could do that.

773
00:47:29,597 --> 00:47:31,473
If you successfully do so,

774
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:36,811
I will compensate you to the
tune of 10% of the recovered sum.

775
00:47:36,896 --> 00:47:38,897
A hundred...
Thousand. Yes.

776
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:41,733
Bones or clams or
whatever you call them.

777
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:46,071
Yeah, but what about my...
Your rug, yes.

778
00:47:46,155 --> 00:47:48,740
Well, with that money you
can buy any number of rugs

779
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:51,451
that don't have sentimental
value for me.

780
00:47:51,536 --> 00:47:54,037
And I am sorry about
that crack on the jaw.

781
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:56,581
Oh, that's fine.
That doesn't even...

782
00:47:56,666 --> 00:47:59,209
Here's the name and number of a
doctor who will look at it for you.

783
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:00,877
You will receive no bill.

784
00:48:00,962 --> 00:48:02,546
He's a good man
and thorough.

785
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:04,214
That's thoughtful but...

786
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:07,801
Please see him, Jeffrey.
He's a good man and thorough.

787
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:11,596
Oh, well, all right.

788
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,266
So he says, "My wife's
a pain in the ass.

789
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:16,768
"She's always busting
my frigging agates.

790
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:20,063
"My daughter's married
to a loser bastard.

791
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:23,984
"I got a rash so bad on my
ass I can't even sit down.

792
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:26,319
"But you know me,
I can't complain. "

793
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:30,991
I got a rash, man. Fucking A.

794
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:34,578
I gotta tell you, Tone, man,

795
00:48:34,662 --> 00:48:37,789
earlier today I was really
feeling shitty, man.

796
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:39,791
Really down in the dumps.

797
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:41,251
Lost a little money...

798
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:44,754
Hey, you know what? Forget
about it, huh? Forget about it.

799
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:46,089
Yeah, fuck it, man.

800
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:49,009
You can't be worried about
that shit. Life goes on, man.

801
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:51,803
Well, home, sweet home,
Mr. L.

802
00:48:54,515 --> 00:48:56,808
Hey, yo. Come here.

803
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:59,394
Who's your friend in
the Volkswagen? Huh?

804
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:03,481
Yeah.
He followed us here.

805
00:49:03,566 --> 00:49:06,484
When did he start...
Whoa! What the fuck?

806
00:49:06,569 --> 00:49:08,695
Get in the limo, you son
of a bitch! No arguments!

807
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:11,656
Hey! Hey! Careful, man!
There's a beverage here!

808
00:49:13,326 --> 00:49:15,785
Start talking, and talk
fast, you lousy bum.

809
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:17,704
We've been frantically
trying to reach you, Dude.

810
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:20,332
Where is my goddamn money,
you bum?

811
00:49:21,876 --> 00:49:24,586
Well, we... I don't...

812
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:26,963
They did not receive
the money, you nitwit!

813
00:49:27,048 --> 00:49:28,632
They did not
receive the money!

814
00:49:28,716 --> 00:49:31,009
Her life was
in your hands!

815
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:32,636
This is our concern, Dude.

816
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,763
No, man.
Nothing is fucked here.

817
00:49:34,847 --> 00:49:36,765
Nothing is fucked?
No, man.

818
00:49:36,849 --> 00:49:40,644
The goddamn plane has
crashed into the mountain!

819
00:49:40,728 --> 00:49:44,981
Man, come on. Who are you
gonna believe, those guys or...

820
00:49:45,066 --> 00:49:46,816
We dropped off the damn money.

821
00:49:46,901 --> 00:49:48,193
We?

822
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:52,489
I, the royal we.

823
00:49:52,573 --> 00:49:53,907
You know. The editorial...

824
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:56,034
I dropped off the money
exactly as per...

825
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:59,871
Look, man, I've got certain
information. All right?

826
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:02,457
Certain things have
come to light and...

827
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:05,168
You know, has it ever
occurred to you

828
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:10,674
that instead of, you know,
running around, blaming me...

829
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:12,967
You know, given the nature
of all this new shit,

830
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:18,890
you know, this could be
a lot more complex...

831
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:23,937
I mean, it's not just... It might
not be just such a simple... You know?

832
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:27,524
What in God's holy name
are you blathering about?

833
00:50:27,608 --> 00:50:29,984
Well, I'll tell you what
I'm blathering about.

834
00:50:30,069 --> 00:50:32,028
I've got information, man.

835
00:50:32,113 --> 00:50:33,863
New shit has come to light.

836
00:50:33,948 --> 00:50:35,907
And, shit, man,

837
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,786
she kidnapped herself.

838
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:45,542
Well, sure, man.
Look at it. You know?

839
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:49,546
A young trophy wife, in the
parlance of our times, you know.

840
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:54,801
She owes money all over town,
including to known pornographers.

841
00:50:56,721 --> 00:50:58,972
And that's cool.
That's cool.

842
00:50:59,849 --> 00:51:03,685
I'm saying she
needs money, man.

843
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:07,439
And, you know, of course they're
gonna say they didn't get it

844
00:51:08,733 --> 00:51:11,568
because she wants more, man.

845
00:51:11,652 --> 00:51:14,070
She's gotta feed the monkey.
I mean...

846
00:51:16,407 --> 00:51:19,492
Hasn't that ever
occurred to you, man?

847
00:51:19,577 --> 00:51:20,660
Sir?

848
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:26,207
No, Mr. Lebowski, it
had not occurred to me.

849
00:51:26,292 --> 00:51:28,501
That had not
occurred to us, Dude.

850
00:51:28,586 --> 00:51:30,044
Well, okay, you know?

851
00:51:30,129 --> 00:51:34,632
You guys aren't privy to all
the new shit, so, you know...

852
00:51:34,717 --> 00:51:38,094
But, hey, that's what you...
That's what you pay me for.

853
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:41,639
Speaking of which,

854
00:51:41,724 --> 00:51:46,060
do you think that you could
give me my $20,000 in cash?

855
00:51:46,145 --> 00:51:49,105
My concern is, and I've gotta
check it with my accountant,

856
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:51,941
that this might bump me up
into a higher tax...

857
00:51:52,026 --> 00:51:54,611
Brandt, give him
the envelope.

858
00:51:55,321 --> 00:51:59,282
Oh, well, if you've already got
the check made out, that's cool.

859
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:01,367
We received this
this morning.

860
00:52:03,913 --> 00:52:07,290
Since you have
failed to achieve,

861
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:10,877
even in the modest task
which was your charge,

862
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:14,130
since you have
stolen my money,

863
00:52:14,215 --> 00:52:17,926
since you have unrepentantly
betrayed my trust,

864
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:21,971
I have no choice
but to tell these bums

865
00:52:22,056 --> 00:52:24,265
to do whatever is necessary

866
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:28,478
to recover their money
from you, Jeffrey Lebowski.

867
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:33,817
And with Brandt as my witness,
I will tell you this,

868
00:52:33,901 --> 00:52:37,153
any further harm
visited upon Bunny

869
00:52:37,238 --> 00:52:40,865
will be visited tenfold
upon your head.

870
00:52:43,244 --> 00:52:44,702
By God, sir,

871
00:52:45,246 --> 00:52:48,248
I will not abide another toe.

872
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:54,254
I hear the cottonwoods
whispering above

873
00:52:54,338 --> 00:52:56,464
That wasn't her toe, Dude.

874
00:52:58,217 --> 00:53:01,219
Whose toe was it, Walter?
How the fuck should I know?

875
00:53:01,345 --> 00:53:04,848
I do know that nothing about it
indicates... The nail polish, Walter.

876
00:53:04,932 --> 00:53:06,224
Fine, Dude.

877
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:10,186
As if it's impossible to get some nail
polish, apply it to someone else's toe...

878
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:11,563
Someone else...
Pinking shears.

879
00:53:11,647 --> 00:53:13,022
Where the fuck are
they gonna get...

880
00:53:13,107 --> 00:53:15,859
You want a toe?
I can get you a toe.

881
00:53:15,943 --> 00:53:17,819
Believe me,
there are ways, Dude.

882
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:20,196
You don't wanna know about it,
believe me. Yeah, but, Walter...

883
00:53:20,281 --> 00:53:23,700
Hell, I could get you a toe by 3:00
this afternoon with nail polish.

884
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:25,702
These fucking amateurs.
Walter...

885
00:53:25,786 --> 00:53:28,621
They send us a toe, we're supposed
to shit ourselves with fear.

886
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:30,248
Jesus Christ!
Walter...

887
00:53:30,374 --> 00:53:32,458
The point is... They're
gonna kill her, Walter,

888
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:34,210
and then they're
gonna kill me.

889
00:53:34,295 --> 00:53:36,754
Dude, that's...

890
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:40,216
That's just the
stress talking, man.

891
00:53:40,301 --> 00:53:45,346
Now, so far we have what appears to
me to be a series of victimless crimes.

892
00:53:45,431 --> 00:53:47,974
What about the toe?
Forget about the fucking toe!

893
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:51,185
Excuse me, sir. Could you
please keep your voices down?

894
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:53,062
This is a family restaurant.

895
00:53:53,147 --> 00:53:55,565
Oh, please! Dear,
for your information,

896
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:58,443
the Supreme Court has roundly
rejected prior restraint.

897
00:53:58,527 --> 00:54:00,904
Come on. Walter, this is not
a First Amendment thing, man.

898
00:54:00,988 --> 00:54:04,157
Sir, if you don't calm down, I'm
gonna have to ask you to leave.

899
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:07,327
Lady, I got buddies who
died face down in the muck

900
00:54:07,411 --> 00:54:10,079
so that you and I can enjoy
this family restaurant!

901
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:13,541
All right, I'm out of here.
Hey, Dude, don't go away, man.

902
00:54:13,626 --> 00:54:17,587
Come on. This affects all of
us, man! It's our basic freedoms!

903
00:54:22,343 --> 00:54:23,801
I'm staying.

904
00:54:26,013 --> 00:54:28,014
I'm finishing my coffee.

905
00:54:32,853 --> 00:54:34,646
Enjoying my coffee.

906
00:54:50,871 --> 00:54:53,039
The Dude is not in.

907
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:55,959
Leave a message after the
beep. It takes a minute.

908
00:54:57,169 --> 00:55:00,880
Mr. Lebowski, this is Duty
Officer Rolvaag of the LAPD.

909
00:55:00,965 --> 00:55:02,465
We've recovered
your automobile.

910
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:05,843
It can be claimed at the North
Hollywood Auto Circus there on Victory.

911
00:55:05,928 --> 00:55:07,053
Their hours there are...

912
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:08,680
Far out, man. Far fucking out!

913
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:22,527
Hey! This is a private
residence, man.

914
00:55:30,911 --> 00:55:32,745
Oh, nice marmot.

915
00:55:42,506 --> 00:55:46,592
Where is the money, Lebowski?
We wants the money, Lebowski!

916
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:55,810
You think we are kidding or
making with the funny stuff?

917
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:58,187
We could do things you
haven't dreamed of, Lebowski.

918
00:55:58,313 --> 00:56:02,233
Ja, we believes in nothing. We
believes in nothing, Lebowski. Nothing!

919
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:05,653
And tomorrow we come back
and we cut off your johnson.

920
00:56:05,738 --> 00:56:08,990
Excuse me? I said, we
cut off your johnson!

921
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:11,492
Just think about that,
Lebowski.

922
00:56:11,577 --> 00:56:13,494
Your wiggly penis, Lebowski.

923
00:56:13,579 --> 00:56:15,913
Ja. Maybe we stomp on it
and squish it.

924
00:56:24,882 --> 00:56:29,302
It was discovered last night in
Van Nuys lodged against an abutment.

925
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:31,179
Oh, man. Lodged where?

926
00:56:31,263 --> 00:56:33,556
You're lucky she didn't
get chopped, Mr. Lebowski.

927
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:36,059
Oh, man! Must've been
a joyride situation.

928
00:56:36,143 --> 00:56:38,686
They abandoned the vehicle once
they hit the retaining wall.

929
00:56:38,771 --> 00:56:42,106
Oh, my fucking briefcase,
man! It's not here! Shit!

930
00:56:42,191 --> 00:56:43,900
Yeah, I saw that
on the report. Sorry.

931
00:56:43,984 --> 00:56:45,985
You gotta get in
on the other side.

932
00:56:47,029 --> 00:56:50,198
The side view was found
on the road by the car.

933
00:56:51,784 --> 00:56:55,703
You're lucky they left the tape
deck though, and the Creedence.

934
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:58,706
Oh, Jesus!
What's that smell, man?

935
00:56:58,791 --> 00:57:01,834
Yeah. It's probably
a vagrant slept in the car.

936
00:57:01,919 --> 00:57:04,670
Or maybe just used it
as a toilet and moved on.

937
00:57:04,755 --> 00:57:06,005
Hey, man,

938
00:57:07,341 --> 00:57:08,966
are you gonna find these guys?

939
00:57:09,051 --> 00:57:13,596
Or, you know, I mean... You
got any promising leads or...

940
00:57:13,889 --> 00:57:15,431
Leads?

941
00:57:15,516 --> 00:57:17,100
Yeah. Sure.

942
00:57:17,184 --> 00:57:20,436
I'll just check with the boys
down at the crime lab.

943
00:57:20,521 --> 00:57:24,357
They got four more detectives
working on the case.

944
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:26,067
They got us working in shifts!

945
00:57:31,532 --> 00:57:32,698
Leads!

946
00:57:33,534 --> 00:57:35,952
My only hope is that
the big Lebowski kills me

947
00:57:36,036 --> 00:57:37,745
before the Germans
can cut my dick off.

948
00:57:37,830 --> 00:57:38,955
Leads!

949
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:40,706
Now, that is just
ridiculous, Dude.

950
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:42,500
No one's going to
cut your dick off.

951
00:57:42,626 --> 00:57:45,128
Thank you, Walter. Not if I
have anything to say about it.

952
00:57:45,212 --> 00:57:46,254
Thank you, Walter.

953
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:48,381
That makes me feel very secure. Dude?

954
00:57:48,507 --> 00:57:51,425
That makes me feel very
warm inside, man. Dude?

955
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:54,262
This whole fucking thing.

956
00:57:54,346 --> 00:57:57,557
I could be sitting here with
just pee stains on my rug.

957
00:57:57,683 --> 00:58:00,935
But no, man, I got a, you
know... Yeah. Fucking Germans.

958
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:02,186
Nothing changes.

959
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:06,816
Fucking Nazis.
They were Nazis, Dude?

960
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:09,485
Oh, come on, Donny. They
were threatening castration!

961
00:58:09,570 --> 00:58:11,404
Uh-huh. Are we gonna split hairs here?

962
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:12,822
No.
Am I wrong?

963
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:16,200
Well, he didn't... Man,
they were nihilists, man.

964
00:58:16,285 --> 00:58:18,828
They kept saying they
believed in nothing.

965
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:20,246
Nihilists.

966
00:58:21,957 --> 00:58:23,249
Fuck me.

967
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:28,129
I mean, say what you want about the
tenets of national socialism, Dude.

968
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:30,506
At least it's an ethos.
Yeah.

969
00:58:30,591 --> 00:58:33,301
And, also, let's not forget...
Let's not forget, Dude,

970
00:58:33,385 --> 00:58:36,345
that keeping wildlife,
an amphibious rodent,

971
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:39,974
for, you know,
domestic...

972
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:41,809
Within the city...

973
00:58:42,603 --> 00:58:45,688
That ain't legal, either. What
are you, a fucking park ranger now?

974
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:47,356
No! I'm just
trying to...

975
00:58:47,441 --> 00:58:50,151
Who gives a shit
about the fucking marmot?

976
00:58:50,277 --> 00:58:53,487
We are sympathizing
here, Dude. Fuck sympathy.

977
00:58:53,572 --> 00:58:57,491
I don't need your fucking sympathy,
man. I need my fucking johnson.

978
00:58:58,452 --> 00:59:01,662
What do you need that for, Dude?
You have got to buck up, man!

979
00:59:01,747 --> 00:59:04,540
You cannot drag this negative
energy into the tournament.

980
00:59:04,625 --> 00:59:07,293
Fuck the tournament.
Fuck you, Walter.

981
00:59:10,005 --> 00:59:12,006
Fuck the tournament?

982
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:15,092
Okay, Dude. I can see you don't
want to be cheered up here.

983
00:59:15,177 --> 00:59:17,637
Come on, Donny.
Let's go get us a lane.

984
00:59:22,643 --> 00:59:25,311
Another Caucasian, Gary.
Right, Dude.

985
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:31,150
Friends like these, huh,
Gary? That's right, Dude.

986
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:59,387
You got a good sarsaparilla?
Sioux City Sarsaparilla?

987
00:59:59,471 --> 01:00:01,430
Yeah. That's a good one.

988
01:00:04,518 --> 01:00:06,811
How're you doing there,
Dude?

989
01:00:06,895 --> 01:00:08,980
Not too good, man.

990
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:11,983
One of those days, huh?
Yeah.

991
01:00:13,193 --> 01:00:17,947
Well, a wiser fellow
than myself once said,

992
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:19,824
"Sometimes you eat
the bear and... "

993
01:00:21,368 --> 01:00:23,452
Much obliged.

994
01:00:23,537 --> 01:00:27,373
"Sometimes the bear,
well, he eats you. "

995
01:00:29,084 --> 01:00:31,794
That some kind of
Eastern thing?

996
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:33,337
Far from it.

997
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:42,054
I like your style, Dude.

998
01:00:43,307 --> 01:00:47,310
Oh, well, I dig
your style, too, man.

999
01:00:47,394 --> 01:00:49,687
Got a whole cowboy thing
going.

1000
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:55,526
Thank you.

1001
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:57,528
There's just one thing, Dude.

1002
01:00:57,612 --> 01:00:59,363
What's that?

1003
01:00:59,448 --> 01:01:02,074
Do you have to use
so many cuss words?

1004
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:07,788
What the fuck are
you talking about?

1005
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:11,542
Okay, Dude. Have it your way.

1006
01:01:13,837 --> 01:01:16,172
Take her easy, Dude.

1007
01:01:16,256 --> 01:01:17,923
Yeah. Thanks, man.

1008
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:25,639
Call for you, Dude.

1009
01:01:29,311 --> 01:01:33,064
Hello? Jeffrey, you have
not gone to the doctor.

1010
01:01:33,148 --> 01:01:36,233
Oh, yeah, no.
No, I haven't yet.

1011
01:01:36,318 --> 01:01:38,819
I'd like to see you
immediately.

1012
01:01:39,738 --> 01:01:40,780
Oh?

1013
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:56,754
So, you're Lebowski.
Yeah.

1014
01:01:59,633 --> 01:02:01,759
Maude has told me
all about you.

1015
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:04,303
She'll be back in a minute.
Sit down.

1016
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:07,723
Do you want a drink?
Yeah, sure. White Russian.

1017
01:02:08,683 --> 01:02:10,476
The bar's over there.

1018
01:02:15,315 --> 01:02:19,402
So, what do you do, Lebowski?
Who the fuck are you, man?

1019
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:24,740
Just a friend of Maudie's. Yeah?
The friend with the cleft asshole?

1020
01:02:27,911 --> 01:02:30,454
What do you do?
Oh, nothing much.

1021
01:02:31,665 --> 01:02:33,582
Hello, Jeffrey.
Hello.

1022
01:02:33,667 --> 01:02:36,544
Yeah. How are you?
Listen, Maude.

1023
01:02:37,295 --> 01:02:38,838
I got to

1024
01:02:41,174 --> 01:02:43,467
tender my resignation
or whatever

1025
01:02:43,552 --> 01:02:48,556
because looks like your mother
really was kidnapped after all.

1026
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:50,683
She most certainly was not.

1027
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:55,813
Hey, man, why don't you
fucking listen occasionally?

1028
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:58,441
You might learn something.
Now, I got...

1029
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:01,360
Please don't call her
my mother.

1030
01:03:01,445 --> 01:03:04,280
She's most definitely the
perpetrator and not the victim.

1031
01:03:04,364 --> 01:03:07,199
I'm telling you, I've got
pretty definitive evidence.

1032
01:03:07,284 --> 01:03:10,119
From who?
From the main guy, Uli.

1033
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:13,539
Uli Kunkel? Her costar
in the beaver picture?

1034
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:18,294
You mean vagina?
I mean, you know the guy?

1035
01:03:18,378 --> 01:03:21,213
I might have introduced them,
for all I know.

1036
01:03:21,298 --> 01:03:23,466
Do you remember Uli?

1037
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:26,302
He's a musician. Used to
have a group, Autobahn.

1038
01:03:26,386 --> 01:03:30,931
Look in my LP's. They released
one album in the late '70s.

1039
01:03:31,016 --> 01:03:33,934
Their music is
sort of a techno pop.

1040
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:37,480
So he's pretending to be
the abductor? Well, yeah.

1041
01:03:37,564 --> 01:03:40,941
Look, Jeffrey, you don't really
kidnap someone you're acquainted with.

1042
01:03:41,026 --> 01:03:45,529
The whole idea is that the hostage can't
identify you after you've let them go.

1043
01:03:45,614 --> 01:03:47,323
Well, I know that.

1044
01:03:51,495 --> 01:03:54,163
What the fuck is with
this guy? Who is he?

1045
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:57,750
Knox Harrington,
the video artist.

1046
01:03:57,834 --> 01:03:59,752
So, Uli has the money.

1047
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:04,507
Well, no, not exactly.

1048
01:04:05,383 --> 01:04:07,218
This is a very complicated
case, Maude.

1049
01:04:09,387 --> 01:04:10,513
a lot of what-have-yous

1050
01:04:10,597 --> 01:04:13,182
and a lot of strands
to keep in my head, man.

1051
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:15,726
You know, a lot of strands
in the old Duder's head.

1052
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:17,019
Hello?

1053
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:18,979
If Uli doesn't have it,
then who does?

1054
01:04:19,064 --> 01:04:20,981
It's Sandra
about the Biennale.

1055
01:04:21,066 --> 01:04:24,568
Look. I have to take this. Do you
still have that doctor's number?

1056
01:04:24,653 --> 01:04:28,197
No, really, it's not even bruised
anymore. Oh, please, Jeffrey.

1057
01:04:28,281 --> 01:04:31,367
I don't want to be responsible
for any delayed aftereffects.

1058
01:04:33,912 --> 01:04:35,538
Aftereffects?

1059
01:05:04,985 --> 01:05:08,279
Could you slide your shorts
down, Mr. Lebowski, please?

1060
01:05:08,363 --> 01:05:09,446
Mmm?

1061
01:05:09,781 --> 01:05:11,740
No, no, man.
She hit me right here.

1062
01:05:11,825 --> 01:05:15,494
I understand. Could you slide
your shorts down, please?

1063
01:07:48,148 --> 01:07:51,608
He lives in North Hollywood on
Radford, near the In-N-Out Burger.

1064
01:07:51,693 --> 01:07:53,861
No, the In-N-Out
Burger's on Camrose.

1065
01:07:53,945 --> 01:07:56,363
Near the In-N-Out Burger.
Those are good burgers, Walter.

1066
01:07:56,448 --> 01:07:59,324
Shut the fuck up, Donny. The
kid is in the ninth grade, Dude.

1067
01:07:59,409 --> 01:08:02,035
And his father is...
Are you ready for this?

1068
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:05,456
His father is
Arthur Digby Sellers.

1069
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:07,124
Who the fuck is that?

1070
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:10,252
Who the fuck is Arthur
Digby Sellers? Who the...

1071
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:12,713
Have you ever heard of a little
show called Branded, Dude?

1072
01:08:12,797 --> 01:08:13,839
Yes, yes, I...

1073
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:15,924
"All but one man died
there at Bitter Creek. "

1074
01:08:16,009 --> 01:08:18,260
I know the fucking show,
Walter. So what?

1075
01:08:18,344 --> 01:08:22,389
Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers
wrote 156 episodes, Dude.

1076
01:08:22,474 --> 01:08:24,183
The bulk of the series.

1077
01:08:24,267 --> 01:08:25,309
Oh.

1078
01:08:25,351 --> 01:08:27,936
Not exactly a lightweight. No.

1079
01:08:28,021 --> 01:08:30,355
And yet his son
is a fucking dunce.

1080
01:08:31,858 --> 01:08:34,568
Anyway, we'll go there
after the what-have-you.

1081
01:08:34,652 --> 01:08:36,320
We'll brace the kid.
Should be a pushover.

1082
01:08:36,404 --> 01:08:37,613
We'll be near
the In-N-Out Burger.

1083
01:08:37,697 --> 01:08:38,822
Shut the fuck up, Donny!

1084
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:44,328
We'll go out there, we'll brace
the kid. He should be a pushover.

1085
01:08:44,412 --> 01:08:46,538
We'll get that fucking
million dollars back,

1086
01:08:46,623 --> 01:08:48,749
if he hasn't
spent it already.

1087
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:50,876
A million fucking clams.

1088
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:54,630
And, yes, we'll be
near the... In-N-Out.

1089
01:08:55,048 --> 01:08:58,467
Shh! Shh! Some burgers,
some beers. A few laughs.

1090
01:09:01,179 --> 01:09:03,472
Our fucking troubles
are over, Dude.

1091
01:09:15,944 --> 01:09:18,946
Oh, fuck me, man.

1092
01:09:19,030 --> 01:09:21,824
That kid's already spent
all the money, man.

1093
01:09:21,908 --> 01:09:24,159
New Vette? Hardly, Dude.

1094
01:09:24,244 --> 01:09:29,581
I'd say he still has $960,000,
$970,000 left, depending on the options.

1095
01:09:30,291 --> 01:09:31,291
Wait in the car, Donny.

1096
01:09:35,463 --> 01:09:37,464
Yes?
Pilar?

1097
01:09:38,675 --> 01:09:42,803
My name is Walter Sobchak. This
is my associate, Jeffrey Lebowski.

1098
01:09:44,222 --> 01:09:46,515
We came to talk
about little Larry.

1099
01:09:46,599 --> 01:09:48,684
May we come in?
Yes, yes.

1100
01:09:48,768 --> 01:09:50,102
Thank you.

1101
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:56,066
That's him, Dude.

1102
01:10:03,616 --> 01:10:06,076
And a good day
to you, sir!

1103
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:08,161
Sit down, please.

1104
01:10:13,585 --> 01:10:16,378
Larry, sweetie,
the man is here!

1105
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:19,298
Is he...
Does he still write?

1106
01:10:19,382 --> 01:10:22,509
Oh, no, no.
He has health problems.

1107
01:10:22,677 --> 01:10:23,886
Uh-huh.

1108
01:10:25,638 --> 01:10:27,681
Sir, I just want to say

1109
01:10:28,683 --> 01:10:31,143
that we're both,
on a personal level,

1110
01:10:32,645 --> 01:10:34,605
really enormous fans.

1111
01:10:34,689 --> 01:10:37,858
Branded, especially
the early episodes,

1112
01:10:37,942 --> 01:10:40,068
was truly a source
of inspiration.

1113
01:10:40,153 --> 01:10:42,946
Sweetie, sit down.
This man is the police.

1114
01:10:43,031 --> 01:10:46,617
Oh, no, ma'am. We didn't want to give the
impression that we were police, exactly.

1115
01:10:46,701 --> 01:10:49,453
We're hoping it won't be
necessary to call the police.

1116
01:10:49,537 --> 01:10:51,997
But that's up to
little Larry here.

1117
01:10:52,081 --> 01:10:53,707
Isn't it, Larry?

1118
01:11:04,594 --> 01:11:06,720
Is this your homework,
Larry?

1119
01:11:08,181 --> 01:11:10,390
Is this your homework,
Larry? Look, man, it...

1120
01:11:10,475 --> 01:11:13,852
Dude. Please? Is this
your homework, Larry?

1121
01:11:13,937 --> 01:11:15,312
Just ask him about
the car, man.

1122
01:11:15,396 --> 01:11:17,731
Is this yours, Larry? Is
this your homework, Larry?

1123
01:11:17,815 --> 01:11:19,024
Is that your car out front?

1124
01:11:19,067 --> 01:11:22,027
Is this your homework, Larry? We
know it's his fucking homework!

1125
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:24,363
Where's the fucking money,
you little brat?

1126
01:11:24,447 --> 01:11:27,449
Look, Larry, have you
ever heard of Vietnam?

1127
01:11:27,575 --> 01:11:29,868
For Christ's sake, Walter. You
are entering a world of pain, son.

1128
01:11:29,953 --> 01:11:32,621
We know that this is your homework.
We know that you stole the car.

1129
01:11:32,705 --> 01:11:35,248
And the fucking money.
And the fucking money!

1130
01:11:35,333 --> 01:11:37,000
And we know that
this is your homework!

1131
01:11:37,085 --> 01:11:38,293
We're gonna cut
your dick off, Larry.

1132
01:11:38,378 --> 01:11:40,337
You're killing
your father, Larry.

1133
01:11:43,508 --> 01:11:45,592
All right.
This is pointless.

1134
01:11:46,886 --> 01:11:49,554
Okay, time for Plan B.

1135
01:11:51,808 --> 01:11:54,768
You might want to watch out
that front window, Larry.

1136
01:11:56,062 --> 01:11:59,439
Son, this is what happens when
you fuck a stranger in the ass!

1137
01:12:01,109 --> 01:12:03,068
A little language
problem here.

1138
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:05,529
Little prick's
stonewalling me.

1139
01:12:06,406 --> 01:12:07,948
Walter.

1140
01:12:08,658 --> 01:12:10,659
What are you doing, man?

1141
01:12:13,287 --> 01:12:15,080
What are you doing?

1142
01:12:16,416 --> 01:12:18,083
Here you go, Larry.

1143
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:20,168
You see what happens?

1144
01:12:20,253 --> 01:12:22,295
You see what happens, Larry?

1145
01:12:23,047 --> 01:12:24,881
You see what happens?
Oh, great.

1146
01:12:24,966 --> 01:12:28,552
This is what happens when you
fuck a stranger in the ass, Larry.

1147
01:12:31,597 --> 01:12:33,223
This is what happens, Larry.

1148
01:12:33,307 --> 01:12:35,142
You see what happens, Larry?

1149
01:12:35,226 --> 01:12:37,644
You see what happens when you
fuck a stranger in the ass?

1150
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:40,063
This is what happens!

1151
01:12:42,316 --> 01:12:44,693
You see what happens, Larry?

1152
01:12:44,777 --> 01:12:48,488
Do you see what happens, Larry,
when you fuck a stranger in the ass?

1153
01:12:49,741 --> 01:12:53,035
This is what happens, Larry!

1154
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:55,871
My car! My baby!
This is what happens, Larry!

1155
01:12:55,955 --> 01:12:57,914
This is what happens
when you fuck a stranger...

1156
01:12:57,999 --> 01:13:00,667
What the fuck are you
doing, man? Stop it!

1157
01:13:00,793 --> 01:13:03,253
Hey, man. I just bought
that fucking car last week!

1158
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:06,381
Whoa, whoa, whoa! I'm sorry!
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

1159
01:13:06,507 --> 01:13:09,634
I just bought the fucking
car last week! Come on, man.

1160
01:13:09,719 --> 01:13:11,553
I'll kill your
fucking car, man!

1161
01:13:11,637 --> 01:13:13,680
No, no. Hey, hey,
that's not his! Hey!

1162
01:13:13,765 --> 01:13:16,224
God damn it!
Whoa! Oh, no!

1163
01:13:16,309 --> 01:13:18,101
Fuck you!
Man. No.

1164
01:13:18,186 --> 01:13:20,687
You like that? Fuck you!

1165
01:13:20,772 --> 01:13:24,232
I'll kill your fucking car!
No. No, no. No.

1166
01:13:24,317 --> 01:13:26,234
I'll kill your fucking car!

1167
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:49,174
I accept your apology.

1168
01:13:50,343 --> 01:13:53,845
No, I just want to handle it
by myself from now on.

1169
01:13:55,056 --> 01:13:57,099
No. No. No!

1170
01:13:57,183 --> 01:13:59,017
That has nothing
to do with it.

1171
01:14:00,394 --> 01:14:03,772
Yes, the car made it home.
You're calling me at home.

1172
01:14:05,399 --> 01:14:10,153
No, Walter, it did not look
like Larry was about to crack!

1173
01:14:12,365 --> 01:14:14,366
Well, that's your perception.

1174
01:14:16,077 --> 01:14:18,745
You know, Walter,
you're right.

1175
01:14:18,830 --> 01:14:20,789
There is an unspoken
message here.

1176
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:23,291
It's, "Fuck you!
Leave me the fuck alone!"

1177
01:14:26,212 --> 01:14:28,046
Yeah, I'll be at practice.

1178
01:14:45,648 --> 01:14:47,482
Pin your diapers on,
Lebowski.

1179
01:14:47,567 --> 01:14:49,317
Jackie Treehorn
wants to see you.

1180
01:14:49,402 --> 01:14:52,279
Jackie Treehorn knows which
Lebowski you are, Lebowski.

1181
01:14:52,363 --> 01:14:55,198
Jackie Treehorn wants to
see the deadbeat Lebowski.

1182
01:14:55,283 --> 01:14:57,159
You're not dealing
with morons here.

1183
01:15:45,208 --> 01:15:48,210
Hello, Dude.
Thanks for coming.

1184
01:15:48,294 --> 01:15:49,961
I'm Jackie Treehorn.

1185
01:15:52,882 --> 01:15:55,592
This is quite a pad
you got here, man.

1186
01:15:55,676 --> 01:15:57,677
Completely unspoiled.

1187
01:15:57,762 --> 01:16:00,972
What's your drink, Dude?
A White Russian. Thanks.

1188
01:16:01,849 --> 01:16:03,141
White Russian.

1189
01:16:03,768 --> 01:16:07,729
How's the smut business,
Jackie? I wouldn't know, Dude.

1190
01:16:07,813 --> 01:16:13,235
I deal in publishing,
entertainment, political advocacy.

1191
01:16:13,319 --> 01:16:16,571
Which one's Logjammin'?
Yes, regrettably, it's true.

1192
01:16:16,656 --> 01:16:19,491
Standards have fallen
in adult entertainment.

1193
01:16:19,575 --> 01:16:21,201
It's video, Dude.

1194
01:16:22,036 --> 01:16:23,870
Now that we're competing
with those amateurs,

1195
01:16:23,955 --> 01:16:27,499
we can't afford to invest
in little extras like story,

1196
01:16:28,334 --> 01:16:31,253
production value, feelings.

1197
01:16:33,005 --> 01:16:38,218
You know, people forget that the
brain is the biggest erogenous zone.

1198
01:16:38,844 --> 01:16:40,428
On you maybe.

1199
01:16:40,513 --> 01:16:42,430
Of course, you have to take
the good with the bad.

1200
01:16:42,515 --> 01:16:45,433
New technology permits us
to do very exciting things

1201
01:16:45,518 --> 01:16:48,228
in interactive
erotic software.

1202
01:16:48,312 --> 01:16:52,399
Wave of the future, Dude.
100% electronic.

1203
01:16:53,734 --> 01:16:56,361
Well, I still jerk off
manually.

1204
01:16:58,656 --> 01:17:03,034
Of course you do. I can see you're
anxious for me to get to the point.

1205
01:17:03,119 --> 01:17:05,829
Well, here it is, Dude.

1206
01:17:05,913 --> 01:17:07,497
Where's Bunny?

1207
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:10,125
Well, I thought you might
know that, man. Why would I?

1208
01:17:10,209 --> 01:17:14,462
She only ran off to get away from
that rather sizable debt to me.

1209
01:17:14,547 --> 01:17:16,965
No, she didn't run off.
She's been...

1210
01:17:17,049 --> 01:17:19,134
I heard that kidnapping story,
so save it.

1211
01:17:19,218 --> 01:17:21,219
I know you're mixed up
in all this, Dude.

1212
01:17:22,847 --> 01:17:25,974
And I don't care what you're
trying to get from the husband.

1213
01:17:26,058 --> 01:17:27,559
That's your business.

1214
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:31,479
All I'm saying is I want mine.

1215
01:17:31,564 --> 01:17:32,814
Yeah, right, man.

1216
01:17:32,898 --> 01:17:36,776
I mean, there are a lot of
facets to this,

1217
01:17:36,902 --> 01:17:38,778
a lot of interested parties.

1218
01:17:39,196 --> 01:17:40,530
Excuse me.

1219
01:17:46,245 --> 01:17:47,329
Yeah?

1220
01:17:48,289 --> 01:17:49,456
Oh, yeah?

1221
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:50,957
Where is that?

1222
01:17:54,587 --> 01:17:56,713
All right. Yeah.

1223
01:17:59,717 --> 01:18:01,051
Excuse me.

1224
01:18:36,545 --> 01:18:40,215
Forgive me.
No problemo, man.

1225
01:18:40,299 --> 01:18:44,636
So, if I can find your money,

1226
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:48,306
what's in it for the Dude?

1227
01:18:48,391 --> 01:18:51,559
Well, of course, there's that
to discuss. You want a refill?

1228
01:18:51,644 --> 01:18:55,105
Yeah, does the pope shit in
the woods? 10% finder's fee.

1229
01:18:55,189 --> 01:18:58,650
That all right?
Okay. Done, Jackie.

1230
01:18:59,610 --> 01:19:01,903
I dig the way
you do business, man.

1231
01:19:01,987 --> 01:19:05,615
Your money is being held by
a kid named Larry Sellers.

1232
01:19:05,699 --> 01:19:08,451
He lives in North Hollywood
on Radford,

1233
01:19:09,662 --> 01:19:12,163
by the In-N-Out Burger.

1234
01:19:12,248 --> 01:19:13,289
Fucking brat.

1235
01:19:13,374 --> 01:19:17,585
But I'm sure your goons can
get it off him. I mean, he's 15.

1236
01:19:19,839 --> 01:19:21,798
Flunking social studies.

1237
01:19:25,177 --> 01:19:28,054
So, if you could just

1238
01:19:28,139 --> 01:19:32,434
write me a check for
my 10% of half a million,

1239
01:19:32,518 --> 01:19:35,603
5 grand,
I'll go out and mingle.

1240
01:19:40,067 --> 01:19:42,527
You mix a hell of
a Caucasian, Jackie.

1241
01:19:44,029 --> 01:19:46,114
Fifteen-year-old kid.

1242
01:19:46,866 --> 01:19:50,869
Is this some sort of a joke?
No. No joke.

1243
01:19:52,663 --> 01:19:55,790
No funny stuff, Jackie.
The kid's got it.

1244
01:19:55,875 --> 01:19:57,041
Hi, fellas.

1245
01:19:59,753 --> 01:20:01,379
Kid just wanted a car.

1246
01:20:04,675 --> 01:20:08,052
All the Dude ever wanted
was his rug back.

1247
01:20:08,554 --> 01:20:09,888
Not greedy.

1248
01:20:11,557 --> 01:20:12,932
It really

1249
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:16,269
tied the room together.

1250
01:20:19,231 --> 01:20:22,400
Darkness washed
over the Dude.

1251
01:20:22,485 --> 01:20:26,988
Darker than a black steer's
tokus on a moonless prairie night.

1252
01:20:27,948 --> 01:20:30,742
There was no bottom.

1253
01:24:39,366 --> 01:24:41,200
Is this your only ID?

1254
01:24:41,994 --> 01:24:43,911
I know my rights, man.

1255
01:24:46,039 --> 01:24:47,790
You don't know shit, Lebowski.

1256
01:24:47,875 --> 01:24:50,585
I want a fucking lawyer,
man.

1257
01:24:50,669 --> 01:24:54,839
I want Bill Kunstler, man,

1258
01:24:56,341 --> 01:24:58,050
or Ron Kuby.

1259
01:24:58,135 --> 01:25:01,304
Mr. Treehorn tells us
that he had to eject you

1260
01:25:01,388 --> 01:25:03,389
from his garden party,

1261
01:25:03,849 --> 01:25:05,767
that you were drunk
and abusive.

1262
01:25:05,851 --> 01:25:10,938
Mr. Treehorn treats objects
like women, man.

1263
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:14,567
Mr. Treehorn draws
a lot of water in this town.

1264
01:25:14,651 --> 01:25:17,028
You don't draw shit, Lebowski.

1265
01:25:17,112 --> 01:25:19,822
Now, we got a nice quiet
little beach community here,

1266
01:25:19,907 --> 01:25:22,450
and I aim to keep it
nice and quiet.

1267
01:25:22,534 --> 01:25:24,869
So let me make
something plain.

1268
01:25:25,412 --> 01:25:29,499
I don't like you sucking around
bothering our citizens, Lebowski.

1269
01:25:30,209 --> 01:25:32,460
I don't like your
jerk-off name.

1270
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:33,795
I don't like your
jerk-off face.

1271
01:25:33,879 --> 01:25:35,505
I don't like your
jerk-off behavior.

1272
01:25:35,589 --> 01:25:38,549
And I don't like you,
jerk-off.

1273
01:25:42,221 --> 01:25:44,096
Do I make myself clear?

1274
01:25:47,226 --> 01:25:49,227
I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.

1275
01:25:50,729 --> 01:25:51,771
Ow!

1276
01:25:51,855 --> 01:25:53,439
Fucking fascist!

1277
01:25:55,067 --> 01:25:57,235
Stay out of Malibu,
Lebowski.

1278
01:25:58,070 --> 01:26:00,196
Stay out of Malibu, deadbeat!

1279
01:26:01,365 --> 01:26:05,868
Keep your ugly, fucking, gold-bricking
ass out of my beach community.

1280
01:26:18,674 --> 01:26:21,843
Jesus, man. Could you
change the channel?

1281
01:26:21,927 --> 01:26:23,594
Fuck you, man! If you
don't like my fucking music,

1282
01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:25,179
get your own fucking cab!

1283
01:26:25,264 --> 01:26:26,347
I had a really rough...

1284
01:26:26,431 --> 01:26:28,182
I'll pull off to the side
and kick your ass out.

1285
01:26:28,267 --> 01:26:32,979
Man, come on. I had a rough night,
and I hate the fucking Eagles, man.

1286
01:26:40,737 --> 01:26:43,322
Out of my fucking cab! Out!
Man!

1287
01:26:44,783 --> 01:26:46,951
Man! Man! Hey!

1288
01:27:29,494 --> 01:27:32,121
Oh, Jesus!

1289
01:27:52,059 --> 01:27:53,309
Jeffrey.

1290
01:27:54,227 --> 01:27:56,103
Maude?
Love me.

1291
01:27:58,899 --> 01:28:00,858
That's my robe.

1292
01:28:02,152 --> 01:28:04,070
Tell me about
yourself, Jeffrey.

1293
01:28:04,905 --> 01:28:07,156
Well, not much to tell.

1294
01:28:08,283 --> 01:28:13,913
I was one of the authors
of the Port Huron Statement.

1295
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:17,917
The original Port
Huron Statement. Uh-huh.

1296
01:28:18,377 --> 01:28:21,921
Not the compromised
second draft.

1297
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:25,549
Then I...

1298
01:28:26,718 --> 01:28:29,261
You ever hear of
the Seattle Seven?

1299
01:28:29,346 --> 01:28:30,721
That was me.

1300
01:28:33,976 --> 01:28:36,227
And there were
six other guys.

1301
01:28:37,771 --> 01:28:40,982
And then the music business,
briefly.

1302
01:28:41,066 --> 01:28:42,608
Oh?
Yeah.

1303
01:28:42,693 --> 01:28:44,402
Roadie for Metallica.

1304
01:28:44,486 --> 01:28:45,528
Oh.

1305
01:28:45,612 --> 01:28:47,113
Speed of Sound tour.

1306
01:28:47,489 --> 01:28:48,864
Mmm-hmm.

1307
01:28:49,324 --> 01:28:50,992
Bunch of assholes.

1308
01:28:52,285 --> 01:28:55,663
And then, you know, little
of this, little of that.

1309
01:28:57,040 --> 01:29:00,292
My career's slowed down
a little lately.

1310
01:29:00,377 --> 01:29:03,504
What do you do
for recreation?

1311
01:29:04,297 --> 01:29:05,756
Well, the usual.

1312
01:29:05,841 --> 01:29:08,634
Bowl, drive around,

1313
01:29:10,095 --> 01:29:12,430
the occasional
acid flashback.

1314
01:29:18,645 --> 01:29:20,730
What happened
to your house?

1315
01:29:20,814 --> 01:29:23,357
Oh, Jackie Treehorn
trashed the place.

1316
01:29:23,442 --> 01:29:26,360
He thought I had
your father's money.

1317
01:29:26,445 --> 01:29:29,613
He got me out of the way
while he looked for it.

1318
01:29:29,698 --> 01:29:31,824
Cocktail?
No, thanks.

1319
01:29:31,908 --> 01:29:34,994
It's not my father's money.
It's the foundation's.

1320
01:29:35,495 --> 01:29:38,789
Why did he think you have it?
Who does?

1321
01:29:38,874 --> 01:29:43,335
Oh, Larry Sellers, this high
school kid. Real fucking brat.

1322
01:29:43,420 --> 01:29:46,964
You know, this is a very
complicated case, Maude.

1323
01:29:47,049 --> 01:29:49,050
A lot of ins, a lot of outs.

1324
01:29:49,718 --> 01:29:54,263
You know, fortunately, I'm adhering
to a pretty strict, drug regimen

1325
01:29:54,347 --> 01:29:56,599
to keep my mind,
you know, limber,

1326
01:29:56,683 --> 01:30:00,227
and I'm very fucking close
to your father's money.

1327
01:30:00,312 --> 01:30:02,938
I keep telling you, it's
the foundation's money.

1328
01:30:03,023 --> 01:30:04,648
Father doesn't have any.

1329
01:30:06,234 --> 01:30:08,402
What are you talking about?
He's fucking loaded.

1330
01:30:08,487 --> 01:30:10,821
No, no. The wealth
is all Mother's.

1331
01:30:11,615 --> 01:30:13,074
No, he runs stuff.

1332
01:30:13,492 --> 01:30:15,701
We did let him run one
of the companies briefly,

1333
01:30:15,786 --> 01:30:18,704
but he didn't do very well
at it. Oh, he's, you know...

1334
01:30:18,789 --> 01:30:21,165
No, he helps administer
the charities now,

1335
01:30:21,249 --> 01:30:23,876
and I give him
a reasonable allowance.

1336
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:25,628
He has no money of his own.

1337
01:30:25,712 --> 01:30:27,421
I know how he likes
to present himself.

1338
01:30:27,506 --> 01:30:30,800
Father's weakness is vanity,
hence the slut.

1339
01:30:33,053 --> 01:30:34,678
Do you think he...

1340
01:30:36,181 --> 01:30:37,515
What is that, yoga?

1341
01:30:37,599 --> 01:30:39,975
It increases the chances
of conception.

1342
01:30:42,938 --> 01:30:45,439
Increases...
Well, yes.

1343
01:30:45,524 --> 01:30:48,484
What did you think this was
all about? Fun and games?

1344
01:30:48,568 --> 01:30:50,111
I want a child.

1345
01:30:50,695 --> 01:30:52,530
Okay, yeah, okay.

1346
01:30:52,614 --> 01:30:55,449
But let me... Let me explain
something about the Dude.

1347
01:30:55,534 --> 01:30:58,994
Look, Jeffrey,
I don't want a partner.

1348
01:30:59,079 --> 01:31:02,790
In fact, I don't want the father
to be someone I have to see socially

1349
01:31:02,874 --> 01:31:05,960
or who will have any interest
in raising the child himself.

1350
01:31:07,379 --> 01:31:10,881
Oh. So, that doctor...
Exactly.

1351
01:31:11,967 --> 01:31:14,844
Now, what happened
to your face?

1352
01:31:15,470 --> 01:31:17,596
Did Jackie Treehorn
do that as well?

1353
01:31:17,681 --> 01:31:22,977
No, it was the chief of police
of Malibu, a real reactionary.

1354
01:31:23,061 --> 01:31:24,812
So, your father...

1355
01:31:26,815 --> 01:31:29,733
Oh, yeah, I get it. Yeah. Yeah. What?

1356
01:31:29,818 --> 01:31:34,238
Oh, man. My thinking about this
case has become very uptight.

1357
01:31:34,322 --> 01:31:35,823
Yeah.

1358
01:31:35,907 --> 01:31:37,241
Your father.

1359
01:31:38,243 --> 01:31:41,245
Jeffrey, what are
you talking about?

1360
01:31:43,248 --> 01:31:44,248
Jeffrey!

1361
01:31:44,332 --> 01:31:47,126
Walter, if you're there, pick
up the fucking phone, man.

1362
01:31:47,210 --> 01:31:49,211
Come on, Walter.

1363
01:31:49,296 --> 01:31:52,506
Pick it up, man. This is
an emergency. Dude? Dude?

1364
01:31:52,591 --> 01:31:56,552
Yeah. Listen, Walter. I'm at my
place. I need you to come pick me up.

1365
01:31:56,636 --> 01:31:59,013
I can't drive, Dude.
It's Erev shabbos. What?

1366
01:31:59,097 --> 01:32:00,514
Erev shabbos.
What?

1367
01:32:00,599 --> 01:32:03,767
Erev shabbos. I can't drive.
Man!

1368
01:32:03,852 --> 01:32:06,478
I'm not even supposed to pick up
the phone unless it's an emergency.

1369
01:32:06,563 --> 01:32:09,940
This is a fucking emergency!
I understand.

1370
01:32:10,025 --> 01:32:11,609
That's why I picked up
the phone.

1371
01:32:11,693 --> 01:32:14,987
Walter, you fuck.
We gotta go to Pasadena, man.

1372
01:32:15,071 --> 01:32:17,323
Come pick me up or I'm off
the fucking bowling team.

1373
01:32:32,964 --> 01:32:35,424
Get out of that
fucking car, man!

1374
01:32:36,718 --> 01:32:38,761
Get out of that fucking car!

1375
01:32:38,845 --> 01:32:41,138
Get the fuck
out of the car, man.

1376
01:32:43,141 --> 01:32:45,142
Get out of the fucking...

1377
01:32:45,727 --> 01:32:47,561
Who the fuck are you, man? Easy, man!

1378
01:32:47,646 --> 01:32:49,021
Relax, man.

1379
01:32:50,106 --> 01:32:51,774
No physical harm intended.

1380
01:32:51,858 --> 01:32:54,568
Who the fuck are you? Why
you following me around?

1381
01:32:54,694 --> 01:32:57,863
Come on, fuckhead! Relax,
man. I'm a brother shamus.

1382
01:32:58,865 --> 01:33:00,407
Brother Shamus?

1383
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:03,827
Like an Irish monk?

1384
01:33:03,912 --> 01:33:05,788
What the fuck are
you talking about?

1385
01:33:05,872 --> 01:33:09,833
My name is Da Fino. I'm a
private snoop, like you, man.

1386
01:33:11,127 --> 01:33:13,170
What?
A dick, man.

1387
01:33:13,255 --> 01:33:16,382
And let me tell you something,
I dig your work.

1388
01:33:16,466 --> 01:33:19,426
Playing one side against the
other, in bed with everybody.

1389
01:33:19,511 --> 01:33:21,887
Fabulous stuff, man.
I'm not...

1390
01:33:21,972 --> 01:33:24,890
Fuck it, man. Just stay away
from my fucking lady friend.

1391
01:33:24,975 --> 01:33:27,518
Hey, I'm not messing
with your special lady.

1392
01:33:27,602 --> 01:33:30,104
She's not my special lady.
She's my fucking lady friend.

1393
01:33:30,230 --> 01:33:32,982
I'm just helping her conceive,
man! Hey, man. I'm not...

1394
01:33:33,066 --> 01:33:35,526
Who are you working for?
Lebowski?

1395
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:37,027
Jackie Treehorn?

1396
01:33:38,863 --> 01:33:40,364
The Kneutsons.

1397
01:33:41,741 --> 01:33:44,368
Who the fuck are
the Kneutsons?

1398
01:33:44,452 --> 01:33:48,038
The Kneutsons, it's a
wandering daughter job.

1399
01:33:49,416 --> 01:33:51,959
Bunny Lebowski, man.

1400
01:33:52,043 --> 01:33:54,837
Her real name
is Fawn Kneutson.

1401
01:33:54,921 --> 01:33:56,880
Her parents
want her back, see?

1402
01:33:58,049 --> 01:34:00,009
Jesus fucking Christ.

1403
01:34:00,093 --> 01:34:03,012
Crazy, huh?
Ran away about a year ago.

1404
01:34:03,096 --> 01:34:06,807
The Kneutsons told me I should
show her this when I found her.

1405
01:34:06,891 --> 01:34:10,436
It's the family farm. It's
outside Moorhead, Minnesota.

1406
01:34:10,562 --> 01:34:13,647
They think it'll make
her homesick. Oh, boy.

1407
01:34:13,732 --> 01:34:15,357
How are you gonna keep them
down on the farm

1408
01:34:15,442 --> 01:34:17,401
once they've seen
Karl Hungus?

1409
01:34:18,028 --> 01:34:20,529
She's been kidnapped, Da Fino. Oh, man.

1410
01:34:20,613 --> 01:34:21,822
Or I don't know.
Maybe not.

1411
01:34:21,906 --> 01:34:23,490
But she's definitely
not around.

1412
01:34:23,575 --> 01:34:27,494
Hey, maybe you and me
could pool our resources,

1413
01:34:27,912 --> 01:34:29,747
trade information.

1414
01:34:29,873 --> 01:34:31,665
Professional courtesy?

1415
01:34:32,250 --> 01:34:33,334
Compeers.
You know what I mean?

1416
01:34:33,418 --> 01:34:35,961
Yeah, yeah, I get it.
Fuck off, Da Fino.

1417
01:34:36,046 --> 01:34:38,172
And stay away
from my special...

1418
01:34:38,256 --> 01:34:41,175
From my fucking
lady friend, man!

1419
01:34:43,762 --> 01:34:45,679
The lingonberry pancake.

1420
01:34:50,185 --> 01:34:52,311
Lingonberry pancakes.

1421
01:34:55,940 --> 01:34:57,775
Three pigs in blanket.

1422
01:35:03,782 --> 01:35:05,657
She has
lingonberry pancakes.

1423
01:35:14,417 --> 01:35:17,711
I mean, we totally fucked it
up, man. We fucked up his payoff.

1424
01:35:17,796 --> 01:35:20,005
We got the kidnappers
all pissed off.

1425
01:35:20,090 --> 01:35:22,341
And Lebowski, you know,
he yelled at me a lot,

1426
01:35:22,425 --> 01:35:24,551
but he didn't do
anything, huh?

1427
01:35:24,677 --> 01:35:26,887
Well, sometimes it's
a cathartic... No, no.

1428
01:35:26,971 --> 01:35:29,264
I'm saying that
if he knows I'm a fuckup,

1429
01:35:29,349 --> 01:35:31,725
why does he leave me in charge
of getting his wife back?

1430
01:35:31,810 --> 01:35:35,145
Because he doesn't
fucking want her back, man.

1431
01:35:35,230 --> 01:35:38,399
He's had enough. He no longer
digs her. It's all a show.

1432
01:35:38,483 --> 01:35:42,903
Okay, but then why doesn't he give
a shit about his million bucks?

1433
01:35:42,987 --> 01:35:45,656
I mean, he knows we never
handed off his briefcase,

1434
01:35:45,824 --> 01:35:47,825
but he never asked
for it back.

1435
01:35:47,909 --> 01:35:50,994
The million bucks
was never in the briefcase.

1436
01:35:51,663 --> 01:35:54,706
The briefcase was
fucking empty, man.

1437
01:35:54,791 --> 01:35:57,459
The asshole was hoping
that they would kill her.

1438
01:35:57,544 --> 01:36:00,087
You threw out a ringer
for a ringer.

1439
01:36:00,171 --> 01:36:03,924
Okay, but how does all
this add up to an emergency?

1440
01:36:04,008 --> 01:36:08,220
I'm saying, I see what you're
getting at, Dude. He kept the money.

1441
01:36:08,304 --> 01:36:10,139
My point is...

1442
01:36:10,223 --> 01:36:13,434
Here we are, it's shabbos,
the Sabbath,

1443
01:36:13,518 --> 01:36:17,563
which I'm allowed to break only
if it's a matter of life or death.

1444
01:36:17,647 --> 01:36:20,983
Will you come off it, Walter?
You're not even fucking Jewish, man.

1445
01:36:21,067 --> 01:36:22,734
What the fuck are
you talking about?

1446
01:36:22,819 --> 01:36:24,194
Man, you're fucking
Polish Catholic!

1447
01:36:24,279 --> 01:36:25,904
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1448
01:36:25,989 --> 01:36:28,115
I converted when I married
Cynthia. Come on, Dude.

1449
01:36:28,199 --> 01:36:30,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know this.

1450
01:36:30,285 --> 01:36:32,536
And five fucking years ago,
you were divorced.

1451
01:36:32,620 --> 01:36:34,121
So what are you saying?
When you get divorced,

1452
01:36:34,205 --> 01:36:36,331
you turn in your library card?
You get a new license?

1453
01:36:36,416 --> 01:36:39,501
You stop being Jewish?
This is the driveway.

1454
01:36:39,586 --> 01:36:41,628
Jewish as fucking Tevye.
Man.

1455
01:36:41,713 --> 01:36:45,966
You know, it's all a part
of your sick Cynthia thing.

1456
01:36:46,050 --> 01:36:49,970
Man, taking care of her fucking
dog, going to her fucking synagogue.

1457
01:36:50,054 --> 01:36:51,889
You're living in
the fucking past.

1458
01:36:51,973 --> 01:36:55,309
Three thousand years of beautiful
tradition, from Moses to Sandy Koufax.

1459
01:36:55,393 --> 01:36:58,353
You're goddamn right I'm
living in the fucking past!

1460
01:36:58,438 --> 01:37:00,564
I've... Jesus.

1461
01:37:01,816 --> 01:37:03,734
What the hell happened?

1462
01:37:04,652 --> 01:37:07,488
So viva Las Vegas

1463
01:37:08,907 --> 01:37:11,825
Viva Las Vegas

1464
01:37:16,748 --> 01:37:18,749
Let's go. Fuck it.

1465
01:37:23,087 --> 01:37:24,505
Where was she, man?

1466
01:37:24,589 --> 01:37:26,590
Visiting friends of hers
in Palm Springs.

1467
01:37:26,674 --> 01:37:29,092
She just picked up and left,
never bothered to tell us.

1468
01:37:29,177 --> 01:37:31,678
Well, I guess the fucking
nihilists knew where she was.

1469
01:37:31,763 --> 01:37:33,931
Jesus, Dude. She never
even kidnapped herself.

1470
01:37:34,057 --> 01:37:37,392
Who is this gentleman, Dude?
Who am I? I'm a fucking veteran.

1471
01:37:37,477 --> 01:37:38,685
Come on!
That's who I am.

1472
01:37:38,770 --> 01:37:41,313
You shouldn't go in there,
Dude. He's very angry.

1473
01:37:43,650 --> 01:37:45,025
So, man.

1474
01:37:45,109 --> 01:37:48,904
So? She's back,
no thanks to you.

1475
01:37:48,988 --> 01:37:51,365
Where's the fucking money,
Lebowski?

1476
01:37:51,449 --> 01:37:54,785
A million bucks from fucking,
needy, little Urban Achievers!

1477
01:37:54,869 --> 01:37:56,370
You are scum, man!

1478
01:37:56,454 --> 01:37:58,705
Who the hell is he?
Who am I? Who am I?

1479
01:37:58,790 --> 01:38:00,374
Walter. I'm the guy that's
gonna kick your phony,

1480
01:38:00,458 --> 01:38:01,792
gold-bricking ass,
that's who I am. Man.

1481
01:38:01,876 --> 01:38:03,710
We know the briefcase
was fucking empty.

1482
01:38:03,795 --> 01:38:05,837
We know you kept the
million bucks for yourself.

1483
01:38:05,922 --> 01:38:07,506
You have your story,
I have mine.

1484
01:38:07,590 --> 01:38:10,884
I say I entrusted the money
to you and you stole it.

1485
01:38:10,969 --> 01:38:14,179
As if we would ever dream of
taking your bullshit money!

1486
01:38:14,264 --> 01:38:16,473
You thought that Bunny
had been kidnapped,

1487
01:38:16,558 --> 01:38:18,141
and you were
fucking glad, man.

1488
01:38:18,226 --> 01:38:20,477
You could use it as an excuse
to make some money disappear.

1489
01:38:20,562 --> 01:38:23,855
All you needed was a sap to
pin it on. You just met me.

1490
01:38:23,940 --> 01:38:26,858
You... You human paraquat.

1491
01:38:26,943 --> 01:38:30,404
You figured, "Oh, here's a
loser, you know, a deadbeat.

1492
01:38:30,488 --> 01:38:33,073
"Somebody this square community
won't give a shit about. "

1493
01:38:33,157 --> 01:38:34,741
Well, aren't you?

1494
01:38:35,994 --> 01:38:39,746
Well, yeah, but...
Get out, both of you.

1495
01:38:39,831 --> 01:38:43,083
Look at that fucking phony, Dude,
pretending to be a fucking millionaire.

1496
01:38:43,167 --> 01:38:45,460
Out of this house now,
you bums!

1497
01:38:45,545 --> 01:38:47,129
Let me tell you
something else.

1498
01:38:47,213 --> 01:38:50,966
I've seen a lot of spinals,
Dude, and this guy's a fake.

1499
01:38:51,676 --> 01:38:54,845
A fucking gold-bricker.
Stay away from me, mister!

1500
01:38:54,929 --> 01:38:56,597
This guy fucking walks.

1501
01:38:56,681 --> 01:38:59,016
I've never been more certain
of anything in my life.

1502
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:00,267
You stay away from me!

1503
01:39:00,351 --> 01:39:02,728
Walter, for Christ's sake,
man! He's a cripple.

1504
01:39:02,854 --> 01:39:04,646
I said! Get away from me!
Come on. Come on.

1505
01:39:08,276 --> 01:39:11,945
Yeah, I'll put him down, Dude.
Walk! Achtung, baby!

1506
01:39:29,213 --> 01:39:32,341
Come on, man. Help me
put him back in his chair.

1507
01:39:36,262 --> 01:39:38,263
At least they had the
fucking decency to tell us

1508
01:39:38,348 --> 01:39:40,724
that we were fighting
the communists.

1509
01:39:43,227 --> 01:39:46,647
Whereas this whole fucking
thing, this whole fucking thing

1510
01:39:46,731 --> 01:39:49,566
is nothing about nothing,
about oil,

1511
01:39:49,651 --> 01:39:51,985
which is what I personally
hear, Dude.

1512
01:39:52,070 --> 01:39:54,363
Sure you'll see
some tank battles,

1513
01:39:54,447 --> 01:39:57,991
but fighting in desert is very
different from fighting in canopy jungle.

1514
01:39:59,077 --> 01:40:02,496
I mean, Nam was a foot soldier's
war, whereas this thing should...

1515
01:40:03,456 --> 01:40:05,707
You know, should be
a piece of cake.

1516
01:40:05,792 --> 01:40:09,211
I mean, I had an M16, Jacko,
not an Abrams fucking tank.

1517
01:40:09,337 --> 01:40:12,714
Me and Charlie, eyeball
to eyeball. Yeah.

1518
01:40:12,799 --> 01:40:15,133
That's fucking combat.

1519
01:40:15,218 --> 01:40:18,095
The man in the black
pajamas, Dude.

1520
01:40:18,179 --> 01:40:20,055
Worthy fucking adversary.

1521
01:40:20,139 --> 01:40:23,558
Who's in pajamas, Walter?
Shut the fuck up, Donny.

1522
01:40:23,643 --> 01:40:25,852
Whereas what we have here,

1523
01:40:25,937 --> 01:40:28,105
a bunch of fig eaters
wearing towels on their head,

1524
01:40:28,189 --> 01:40:30,357
trying to find reverse
on a Soviet tank.

1525
01:40:31,234 --> 01:40:33,402
This is not a worthy fucking
adversary.

1526
01:40:33,486 --> 01:40:35,529
Hey! What's this
day-of-rest shit?

1527
01:40:35,613 --> 01:40:37,197
What's this bullshit?

1528
01:40:37,281 --> 01:40:40,325
I don't fucking care!
It don't matter to Jesus.

1529
01:40:40,410 --> 01:40:41,868
But you not fooling me,
man.

1530
01:40:41,953 --> 01:40:44,663
You might fool the fucks
in the league office

1531
01:40:44,747 --> 01:40:47,040
but you don't fool Jesus.

1532
01:40:47,208 --> 01:40:49,918
It's Bush league
psych-out stuff.

1533
01:40:50,002 --> 01:40:51,420
Laughable, man!

1534
01:40:52,588 --> 01:40:55,674
I would've fucked you
in the ass Saturday.

1535
01:40:56,426 --> 01:40:59,344
I'll fuck you in the ass
next Wednesday instead.

1536
01:41:00,805 --> 01:41:03,265
You got a date
Wednesday, baby!

1537
01:41:08,146 --> 01:41:09,312
He's cracking.

1538
01:41:09,397 --> 01:41:11,106
...the whole concept of age.

1539
01:41:11,190 --> 01:41:13,400
I mean, many learned men
have disputed this

1540
01:41:13,484 --> 01:41:16,319
but in the 14th century,
the Rambam...

1541
01:41:26,330 --> 01:41:28,540
Well, they finally
did it.

1542
01:41:28,624 --> 01:41:30,751
They killed
my fucking car.

1543
01:41:30,835 --> 01:41:34,421
We want the money,
Lebowski.

1544
01:41:34,505 --> 01:41:37,007
Ja. Otherwise,
we kill the girl.

1545
01:41:37,091 --> 01:41:40,594
Ja. It seems you have forgotten
our little deal, Lebowski.

1546
01:41:40,678 --> 01:41:43,430
You don't have the
fucking girl, dipshit.

1547
01:41:43,514 --> 01:41:45,766
We know you never did.

1548
01:41:45,850 --> 01:41:47,434
Are these the Nazis,
Walter?

1549
01:41:47,518 --> 01:41:49,227
No, Donny.
These men are nihilists.

1550
01:41:49,312 --> 01:41:50,729
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

1551
01:41:52,398 --> 01:41:53,482
We don't care.

1552
01:41:53,566 --> 01:41:58,028
We still want the money,
Lebowski, or we fuck you up.

1553
01:41:58,112 --> 01:42:00,781
Fuck you. Fuck the three
of you. Cool it, Walter.

1554
01:42:00,865 --> 01:42:04,701
No. Without a hostage,
there is no ransom.

1555
01:42:04,786 --> 01:42:08,121
That's what ransom is.
Those are the fucking rules.

1556
01:42:08,206 --> 01:42:10,540
His girlfriend
gave up her toe.

1557
01:42:10,625 --> 01:42:12,959
She thought we could
get $1 million.

1558
01:42:13,044 --> 01:42:15,545
It's not fair.
Fair?

1559
01:42:15,630 --> 01:42:19,257
Who's the fucking nihilists around
here, you bunch of fucking crybabies?

1560
01:42:19,342 --> 01:42:21,718
Cool it, Walter.
Hey, look, pal.

1561
01:42:21,803 --> 01:42:23,512
There never
was any money.

1562
01:42:23,596 --> 01:42:25,722
The big Lebowski gave me
an empty briefcase,

1563
01:42:25,807 --> 01:42:27,849
so take it up with him, man.

1564
01:42:27,934 --> 01:42:30,477
And I would like
my undies back.

1565
01:42:30,561 --> 01:42:31,770
Are these guys gonna
hurt us, Walter?

1566
01:42:31,854 --> 01:42:34,314
No, Donny.
These men are cowards.

1567
01:42:34,398 --> 01:42:35,690
Okay!

1568
01:42:35,775 --> 01:42:39,319
So we takes the money you have
on you, and we calls it even.

1569
01:42:40,738 --> 01:42:42,781
Fuck you.
Hey, no. Come on, Walter.

1570
01:42:42,865 --> 01:42:44,866
Come on, we're ending
this thing cheap, man.

1571
01:42:44,951 --> 01:42:47,536
No. What's mine is mine.
No, come on, Walter.

1572
01:42:47,620 --> 01:42:49,830
No funny stuff.
All right. All right.

1573
01:42:49,914 --> 01:42:54,668
No funny stuff.
I got 4 bucks, almost 5.

1574
01:42:54,752 --> 01:42:57,337
I got $18.
What's mine is mine.

1575
01:42:57,421 --> 01:43:00,549
We fuck you up, man!
We takes the money!

1576
01:43:01,092 --> 01:43:02,425
Come and get it.

1577
01:43:03,761 --> 01:43:08,014
We fuck you up! Show me
what you got, nihilists.

1578
01:43:08,099 --> 01:43:10,559
I fuck you! Walter, come
on. He's got a sword.

1579
01:43:10,643 --> 01:43:12,853
Fucking dipshit with
a nine-toed woman!

1580
01:43:12,937 --> 01:43:16,773
I fuck you! Fuck you!
I fuck you!

1581
01:43:22,947 --> 01:43:24,614
Take it easy, man.
I fuck you!

1582
01:43:24,699 --> 01:43:26,616
Take the $4.
I fuck you!

1583
01:43:30,955 --> 01:43:31,997
I fuck you!

1584
01:43:32,081 --> 01:43:33,957
I'm gonna hit you with
the fucking ball, man.

1585
01:43:38,713 --> 01:43:40,839
Hey, dickhead!
Anti-Semite.

1586
01:43:41,799 --> 01:43:44,509
I fuck you in the ass!
I fuck you in the ass!

1587
01:43:44,594 --> 01:43:49,806
I fuck you! I fuck you!

1588
01:43:56,063 --> 01:43:58,023
We got a man down, Dude!

1589
01:44:01,736 --> 01:44:02,944
Oh, God. They shot him, man.

1590
01:44:03,029 --> 01:44:05,238
He's not shot. No, Dude.
Are you shot, Donny?

1591
01:44:05,364 --> 01:44:07,657
There weren't any shots fired. Huh?

1592
01:44:07,742 --> 01:44:10,994
It's a heart attack.
Call the medics, Dude.

1593
01:44:11,537 --> 01:44:14,372
I'd go myself, but I'm
pumping blood, might pass out.

1594
01:44:14,457 --> 01:44:17,751
Rest easy, good buddy.
You're doing fine.

1595
01:44:17,835 --> 01:44:20,253
We got help choppering in.

1596
01:44:47,782 --> 01:44:49,449
Hello, gentlemen.

1597
01:44:49,533 --> 01:44:51,785
You are the bereaved?
Yeah, man.

1598
01:44:52,453 --> 01:44:55,121
Francis Donnelly,
pleased to meet you.

1599
01:44:55,206 --> 01:44:57,499
Jeff Lebowski.
Walter Sobchak.

1600
01:44:57,583 --> 01:44:59,834
The Dude actually is...

1601
01:45:00,878 --> 01:45:02,796
Excuse me?
Oh, nothing.

1602
01:45:04,632 --> 01:45:09,302
Yes. I understand you're
taking away the remains?

1603
01:45:09,387 --> 01:45:10,553
Yeah.

1604
01:45:11,305 --> 01:45:13,098
We have the urn.

1605
01:45:14,475 --> 01:45:16,685
I assume this is credit card?

1606
01:45:17,895 --> 01:45:18,979
Yeah.

1607
01:45:33,661 --> 01:45:35,078
What's this?

1608
01:45:35,830 --> 01:45:37,497
Now, that's for the urn.

1609
01:45:37,581 --> 01:45:39,582
Don't need it.
We're scattering the ashes.

1610
01:45:40,376 --> 01:45:43,003
Yes. So we were informed.

1611
01:45:43,087 --> 01:45:46,840
However, we must, of course,
transmit the remains to you

1612
01:45:46,924 --> 01:45:48,508
in a receptacle.

1613
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:51,553
That's $180.

1614
01:45:51,887 --> 01:45:55,807
It is our most modestly
priced receptacle.

1615
01:45:56,142 --> 01:45:58,309
Well, can't we just...
$180?

1616
01:45:58,394 --> 01:46:00,395
They range up to $3,000.

1617
01:46:01,188 --> 01:46:04,315
We're... Can't we just
rent it from you, you know?

1618
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:07,193
Sir, this is a mortuary
not a rental house.

1619
01:46:07,319 --> 01:46:09,654
We're scattering the fucking
ashes! Walter, Walter.

1620
01:46:09,739 --> 01:46:12,240
Just because we're bereaved
doesn't make us saps.

1621
01:46:12,324 --> 01:46:14,701
Sir, please lower
your voices.

1622
01:46:14,785 --> 01:46:18,872
Man, don't you have, you know,
something else we can put him in?

1623
01:46:18,956 --> 01:46:19,998
You know?

1624
01:46:20,082 --> 01:46:23,126
That is our most modestly
priced receptacle.

1625
01:46:23,419 --> 01:46:25,003
God damn it!

1626
01:46:27,131 --> 01:46:28,798
Is there a Ralph's
around here?

1627
01:46:55,826 --> 01:46:58,495
Donny was a good bowler
and a good man.

1628
01:46:59,747 --> 01:47:01,873
He was one of us.

1629
01:47:01,957 --> 01:47:05,877
He was a man who loved
the outdoors and bowling.

1630
01:47:06,003 --> 01:47:09,756
And as a surfer he explored the
beaches of Southern California

1631
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:12,634
from La Jolla to Leo Carrillo

1632
01:47:12,718 --> 01:47:15,303
and up to Pismo.

1633
01:47:16,097 --> 01:47:17,347
He died...

1634
01:47:18,349 --> 01:47:22,435
He died as so many young men of
his generation, before his time.

1635
01:47:22,520 --> 01:47:25,688
In your wisdom, Lord,
you took him,

1636
01:47:25,815 --> 01:47:29,109
as you took so many bright,
flowering young men

1637
01:47:29,193 --> 01:47:32,028
at Khe Sanh, at Lan Doc,

1638
01:47:32,113 --> 01:47:33,863
at Hill 364.

1639
01:47:35,157 --> 01:47:37,534
These young men
gave their lives,

1640
01:47:38,119 --> 01:47:39,577
and so did Donny.

1641
01:47:41,705 --> 01:47:43,706
Donny, who loved bowling.

1642
01:47:46,752 --> 01:47:47,752
And so,

1643
01:47:49,380 --> 01:47:51,756
Theodore Donald Kerabatsos,

1644
01:47:53,050 --> 01:47:58,179
in accordance with what we think your
dying wishes might well have been,

1645
01:47:59,515 --> 01:48:02,308
we commit your final
mortal remains

1646
01:48:03,227 --> 01:48:05,603
to the bosom of
the Pacific Ocean

1647
01:48:07,064 --> 01:48:09,065
which you loved so well.

1648
01:48:11,402 --> 01:48:13,486
Good night, sweet prince.

1649
01:48:28,627 --> 01:48:30,044
Shit.

1650
01:48:31,964 --> 01:48:34,007
Oh, shit, Dude. I'm sorry.

1651
01:48:35,801 --> 01:48:38,928
Goddamn wind.
Fuck, god damn it, Walter!

1652
01:48:39,013 --> 01:48:41,306
You fucking asshole!
Shit, Dude. I'm sorry.

1653
01:48:41,390 --> 01:48:43,600
Everything's a fucking
travesty with you, man!

1654
01:48:43,684 --> 01:48:45,268
I'm sorry.
It was an accident.

1655
01:48:45,352 --> 01:48:47,854
What was that shit about
Vietnam? Dude, I'm sorry.

1656
01:48:47,938 --> 01:48:50,231
What the fuck does anything
have to do with Vietnam?

1657
01:48:50,316 --> 01:48:52,317
Dude, I'm sorry. What the
fuck are you talking about?

1658
01:48:52,401 --> 01:48:53,985
Dude, I'm sorry.

1659
01:48:56,906 --> 01:48:58,114
Fucking...

1660
01:49:05,122 --> 01:49:06,581
Fuck, Walter.

1661
01:49:08,459 --> 01:49:09,959
Come on, Dude.

1662
01:49:10,794 --> 01:49:12,462
Hey, fuck it, man.

1663
01:49:16,383 --> 01:49:18,009
Let's go bowling.

1664
01:50:12,523 --> 01:50:15,525
Two oat sodas, Gary.
Right. Good luck tomorrow.

1665
01:50:15,609 --> 01:50:19,070
Yeah, thanks, man. I was
sorry to hear about Donny.

1666
01:50:19,154 --> 01:50:22,031
Oh, yeah. Well, you know,

1667
01:50:22,866 --> 01:50:26,828
sometimes you eat the bear,
and sometimes, you know...

1668
01:50:26,912 --> 01:50:28,204
Hey, man.

1669
01:50:28,998 --> 01:50:32,166
How do you do, Dude? I
wondered if I'd see you again.

1670
01:50:32,251 --> 01:50:34,294
I wouldn't miss
the semis.

1671
01:50:34,378 --> 01:50:36,004
Oh, yeah?
How's things been going?

1672
01:50:36,088 --> 01:50:39,215
Well, you know, strikes
and gutters, ups and downs.

1673
01:50:39,300 --> 01:50:42,010
Sure. I got you.
Yeah.

1674
01:50:43,554 --> 01:50:44,595
Thanks, Gary.

1675
01:50:44,680 --> 01:50:47,015
Well, take care, man.
Gotta get back.

1676
01:50:47,099 --> 01:50:50,143
Sure. Take it easy, Dude.
Oh, yeah.

1677
01:50:50,227 --> 01:50:52,312
I know that you will.

1678
01:50:52,396 --> 01:50:55,732
Yeah. Well,
the Dude abides.

1679
01:50:59,737 --> 01:51:00,945
Walter.

1680
01:51:02,656 --> 01:51:04,615
The Dude abides.

1681
01:51:08,537 --> 01:51:11,873
I don't know about you,
but I take comfort in that.

1682
01:51:13,167 --> 01:51:15,376
It's good knowing
he's out there,

1683
01:51:15,461 --> 01:51:19,547
the Dude, taking her easy
for all us sinners.

1684
01:51:22,259 --> 01:51:24,427
I sure hope
he makes the finals.

1685
01:51:26,055 --> 01:51:28,181
Well, that about does her.

1686
01:51:28,265 --> 01:51:29,766
Wraps her all up.

1687
01:51:31,352 --> 01:51:34,812
Things seem to have worked out
pretty good for the Dude and Walter.

1688
01:51:35,481 --> 01:51:38,775
And it was a pretty good
story, don't you think?

1689
01:51:39,610 --> 01:51:41,944
Made me laugh
to beat the band.

1690
01:51:42,613 --> 01:51:44,072
Parts anyway.

1691
01:51:45,616 --> 01:51:47,784
I didn't like seeing Donny go.

1692
01:51:48,911 --> 01:51:53,956
But then I happen to know that
there's a little Lebowski on the way.

1693
01:51:55,626 --> 01:51:58,961
I guess that's the way the
whole darned human comedy keeps

1694
01:51:59,505 --> 01:52:01,839
perpetuating itself

1695
01:52:01,924 --> 01:52:04,092
down through the generations.

1696
01:52:04,593 --> 01:52:08,846
Westward the wagons, across
the sands of time until we...

1697
01:52:10,057 --> 01:52:13,267
Oh, look at me.
I'm rambling again.

1698
01:52:14,645 --> 01:52:17,146
Well, I hope you folks
enjoyed yourselves.

1699
01:52:17,648 --> 01:52:19,982
Catch you later on
down the trail.

1700
01:52:21,151 --> 01:52:24,278
Say, friend, you got any more
of that good sarsaparilla?
