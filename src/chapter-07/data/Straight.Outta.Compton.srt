Do you even care how it makes me look?

86
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,240
Called in favors to get
your thoughtless ass

88
00:06:59,161 --> 00:07:01,288
Look, I'm sorry, Ma. I just...

89
00:07:01,372 --> 00:07:04,583
I got so caught up in this DJ stuff,
I forgot.

90
00:07:04,667 --> 00:07:06,293
You have a child, Andre.

91
00:07:06,877 --> 00:07:09,630
Spinnin' records ain't paying
none of the bills around here.

92
00:07:09,713 --> 00:07:11,757
Whatchu talkin' about? I get paid.

93
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:15,469
$50. So that makes you rich?

94
00:07:15,553 --> 00:07:17,221
It's a start. Damn!

95
00:07:17,263 --> 00:07:18,597
Why you riding me so hard?

96
00:07:18,681 --> 00:07:21,767
I'm not riding you, baby.
I'm trying to make you understand.

97
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:24,144
And you know how I run my house.

98
00:07:24,228 --> 00:07:27,398
Now you gonna have to go to school
or you gonna have to go to work.

99
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:29,400
Now I don't even care if you are a janitor.

100
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:30,734
I don't care what the hell you do...

101
00:07:30,818 --> 00:07:33,070
Long as I own the company. I know, I know.

102
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:34,905
But you don't own the company.

103
00:07:34,947 --> 00:07:36,490
- Lonzo does.
- Okay.

104
00:07:37,867 --> 00:07:39,410
You think we're done here?

105
00:07:39,451 --> 00:07:41,537
- Yeah, I mean, you keep...
- You got something to say to me?

106
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:43,831
You don't care what I'm fightin' for, okay?

107
00:07:44,874 --> 00:07:46,750
I already know what
I want to do with my life

108
00:07:46,792 --> 00:07:48,919
and it definitely ain't
sitting in some cubicle,

109
00:07:49,003 --> 00:07:51,088
taking orders on a bullshit-ass job.

110
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:52,339
Shut up!

111
00:07:55,885 --> 00:07:59,471
People used to tell me
I was too young when I had you.

112
00:07:59,555 --> 00:08:01,682
Said I wouldn't be shit.

113
00:08:01,765 --> 00:08:03,142
Said you wouldn't be shit.

114
00:08:04,268 --> 00:08:06,770
Now, I worked my ass off to get us here,

115
00:08:06,812 --> 00:08:09,857
and I refuse to let you throw it all away.

116
00:08:31,253 --> 00:08:33,047
Hey, I grabbed some of your stuff.

117
00:08:33,756 --> 00:08:35,466
Good lookin' out, T.

118
00:08:41,222 --> 00:08:42,514
When you comin' back?

119
00:08:43,807 --> 00:08:45,184
Man, I don't even know.

120
00:08:45,643 --> 00:08:47,645
Got a lotta things to figure out.

121
00:08:48,646 --> 00:08:50,481
Can I come with you?

122
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,233
Really?

123
00:08:52,316 --> 00:08:54,235
You've been crying this whole time
about us sharing a room.

124
00:08:54,318 --> 00:08:56,820
And now you wanna come with me.

125
00:08:56,862 --> 00:08:57,863
Man, get out of here.

126
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,448
You know Mom. She just...

127
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:01,700
She just want the best for you.

128
00:09:03,702 --> 00:09:05,412
Hey, I know that, T.

129
00:09:05,788 --> 00:09:07,998
But check this out,
I want the best for me too.

130
00:09:08,332 --> 00:09:09,583

Don't even worry about it.

135
00:09:20,261 --> 00:09:21,845
For real?

136
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:23,764
- You gotta get me in Miami.
- Yeah, man.

137
00:09:24,098 --> 00:09:26,600
Don't play, man. Get me somewhere.

138
00:09:27,226 --> 00:09:28,602
Hey, I'll call you later.

139
00:09:28,686 --> 00:09:31,564
For now, stay your little
ass outta trouble.

140
00:09:33,107 --> 00:09:34,108
Yeah, yeah.

141
00:09:34,191 --> 00:09:35,943
Hey, nah. For real.

142
00:09:37,403 --> 00:09:39,321

This nigga. Okay. I'll see you.

149
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:56,857
I wish
somebody would try me though.

150
00:10:56,941 --> 00:10:58,609
That's all I'm saying. You feel me?

151
00:10:58,651 --> 00:11:00,778

00:11:42,611 --> 00:11:43,821
What's going on?

166
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:44,989
Shut the fuck up, blood.

167
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:48,367
Y'all niggas ready to die today?

168
00:11:48,826 --> 00:11:50,578
Don't get quiet now.

169
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:53,247
All that shit
y'all was throwin' up out the window?

170
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:55,666
What's up with it, huh?

171
00:11:55,749 --> 00:11:56,917
You didn't think we saw that, huh?

172
00:11:57,001 --> 00:11:58,544
Let me see how you do that shit again.
Let me see.

173
00:11:58,627 --> 00:12:01,046
I was just playin', man, I swear.
I was only playin', man.

174
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:03,716
You think niggas out here are playin'? Huh?

175
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:05,092
Niggas die every day.

176
00:12:06,176 --> 00:12:08,137
I kill Crips for breakfast.

177
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:11,974
Don't you ever put your motherfucking hands
up on no school bus, nigga.

178
00:12:12,016 --> 00:12:13,267
You understand me?

179
00:12:13,475 --> 00:12:14,560
- Yeah.
- Huh?

180
00:12:14,643 --> 00:12:15,686
Yeah.

181
00:12:18,022 --> 00:12:20,190
Y'all motherfuckers need
to gang bang them books

182
00:12:20,274 --> 00:12:22,610
instead of tryin' to be
somethin' y'all ain't.

183
00:12:22,985 --> 00:12:24,778
Shit, you never know.

184
00:12:26,864 --> 00:12:30,201
'Cause I might be the one
to kill your motherfucking ass.

185
00:12:31,869 --> 00:12:33,662
Remember me.

186
00:12:33,704 --> 00:12:37,208
O.G. Two Tone, Crenshaw Mafia, blood.

187
00:13:15,621 --> 00:13:17,081
Yo, Dre and Jinx in there?

188
00:13:17,122 --> 00:13:18,958
Yup, they in there.

189
00:13:26,173 --> 00:13:27,675
- Hey, Auntie.
- Hi, baby.

190
00:13:27,758 --> 00:13:29,093
- How you doin'?
- Just fine.

191
00:13:29,176 --> 00:13:31,762
- Lavetta, where Dre and Jinx at?
- They're in the back.

192
00:13:32,263 --> 00:13:33,305
Excuse me.

193
00:13:33,389 --> 00:13:35,057
Come on. Chill out.

194
00:13:35,099 --> 00:13:36,934
- Hey, little mama.
- Take your nap.

195
00:13:38,769 --> 00:13:40,104
Why didn't you say hi?

196
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:47,903
- Wuddup, Cube?
- Wuddup?

197
00:13:50,864 --> 00:13:51,865
Ooh.

198
00:13:53,367 --> 00:13:54,368
Whoo!

199
00:13:57,621 --> 00:13:58,873
Do that shit!

200
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,292
Damn, Dre!

201
00:14:04,128 --> 00:14:05,129
Whoo!

202
00:14:07,381 --> 00:14:08,465
Damn.

203
00:14:10,509 --> 00:14:11,510
Whoo!

204
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:14,054
Yeah!

205
00:14:17,141 --> 00:14:18,851
That's right.

206
00:14:19,602 --> 00:14:20,811
Whoo!

207
00:14:27,026 --> 00:14:29,403
Whoo! Fuck that shit up, Dre!

208
00:14:29,486 --> 00:14:31,280
- Yo.
- That shit was dope, homie!

209
00:14:31,322 --> 00:14:32,990
- What's up, Cube?
- Man!

210
00:14:33,324 --> 00:14:36,243
I had some crazy shit
happen on the bus today.

211
00:14:36,327 --> 00:14:39,079
I had a Crenshaw Mafia O.G. get on the bus,

212
00:14:39,163 --> 00:14:40,706
pulled a gun out on us,

213
00:14:40,789 --> 00:14:43,542
gave a fucking motivational speech
and then bumped out.

214
00:14:43,834 --> 00:14:45,085
The shit was crazy.

215
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:47,880
You wanna avoid some more crazy shit,

216
00:14:47,963 --> 00:14:50,341
you better not get up
on that stage and fuck up.

217
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,677
Ain't nobody gonna fuck up, man.

218
00:14:55,721 --> 00:14:57,681
- You must be stayin' a while.
- Yup.

219
00:14:57,765 --> 00:14:59,767
Mama kicked him out 'cause of that mouth.

220
00:15:00,976 --> 00:15:02,061
Shut your ass up.

221
00:15:02,144 --> 00:15:03,854
She didn't kick me out. I left.

222
00:15:03,896 --> 00:15:05,147
Whatever.

223
00:15:05,773 --> 00:15:07,942
That's what
they all say, homie. Right?

224
00:15:08,025 --> 00:15:09,026
You got them rhymes?

225
00:15:09,902 --> 00:15:12,029
Man, I stay with the rhymes.

226
00:15:12,696 --> 00:15:14,740
Man, I'm talkin'
about that hard shit.

227
00:15:14,823 --> 00:15:17,743
- All I write is that hard shit, Dre.
- Okay.

228
00:15:17,826 --> 00:15:19,745
So wassup, man? You ready for Doo-to's?

229
00:15:19,828 --> 00:15:21,205
Shit, is Doo-to's ready for me?

230
00:15:21,288 --> 00:15:24,041
You know that's Compton, right?
They got body bags at the door.

231
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:27,503
Okay.

232
00:15:27,545 --> 00:15:28,879
Your ass better bring it,

233
00:15:28,921 --> 00:15:31,882
'cause if you don't,
you might end up in one for real.

234
00:15:32,216 --> 00:15:33,384
Body bag?

235
00:15:33,467 --> 00:15:35,094
Man, I don't know about that shit.

236
00:15:35,177 --> 00:15:37,263
Ain't nobody
fucking with you, Jinx.

237
00:15:37,346 --> 00:15:39,807
Stupid, man.
Tell your moms to fix this fucking AC.

238
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:42,268
Man, what are you doing here, homeless?

239
00:15:44,603 --> 00:15:46,063
Get off of me, nigga!

240
00:15:48,857 --> 00:15:52,069
- Fuck you! Get the fuck off me.
- Stay down.

241
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:53,904
We didn't do shit!

242
00:15:53,988 --> 00:15:56,907
The fuck you holding me for?
Get the fuck off me!

243
00:15:56,991 --> 00:15:58,033
Where the fuck you going?

244
00:15:58,075 --> 00:16:01,370
Hey, man, I'm just trying to get home, man.
I'm not even doin' nothin'.

245
00:16:01,412 --> 00:16:04,081
Put your fucking hands on top of
your head. Interlace your fingers.

246
00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:05,583
Spread your fucking legs.

247
00:16:05,624 --> 00:16:07,251
You need to stay the fuck down.

248
00:16:07,293 --> 00:16:08,752
Man, this hood is fuckin' hot!

249
00:16:08,794 --> 00:16:09,879
Shut the fuck up!

250
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,589
What the hell is going on out here?

251
00:16:11,672 --> 00:16:14,341
Look, these boys,
they all grew up on this block, okay?

252
00:16:14,425 --> 00:16:16,093
- You need to get back in the house.
- That's my son.

253
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:18,596
- That's my... O'Shea! That's my son.
- You need to get back in the house.

254
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:20,431
- Lady, I'm telling you...
- Damn.

255
00:16:20,472 --> 00:16:22,182
You get back inside, or I promise you,

256
00:16:22,266 --> 00:16:24,018
I will ruin your fuckin' night!

257
00:16:24,101 --> 00:16:26,228
Man, you ain't got to talk
to my mom's like that.

258
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:28,939
Shut the fuck up! Motherfuckin' nigger.

259
00:16:28,981 --> 00:16:30,065
Oh, I'm a nigger now?

260
00:16:30,107 --> 00:16:32,443
Wait a minute my ass, motherfucker.

261
00:16:32,526 --> 00:16:33,569
Okay.

262
00:16:33,611 --> 00:16:36,030
Officer, can you explain
why you jacking us right now?

263
00:16:36,113 --> 00:16:38,032
Man, I ain't explaining shit to you.

264
00:16:38,115 --> 00:16:39,575
Get the fuck up off the street.

265
00:16:39,617 --> 00:16:42,703
I'm on my property.
I can stand right here. You got that?

266
00:16:43,037 --> 00:16:45,581
Son! We right here.

267
00:16:45,664 --> 00:16:47,625
Where you got the fuckin' rocks, homeboy?

268
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:49,418
Not everybody's slangin' dope, man.

269
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,378
I don't give a fuck! This LAPD.

270
00:16:51,462 --> 00:16:53,422
- I'm the only gangster out here.
- All right.

271
00:16:53,464 --> 00:16:54,840
They all check out.

272
00:16:54,924 --> 00:16:57,301
Check out? Check what, man?
Y'all are just over here fuckin' with us.

273
00:16:57,384 --> 00:16:58,427
Get up.

274
00:16:58,469 --> 00:16:59,887
We got cards on all of 'em anyway.

275
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:01,013
Pick your shit up.

276
00:17:01,096 --> 00:17:02,431
Stay out of trouble, man.

277
00:17:02,473 --> 00:17:03,682
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Get your ass up!

278
00:17:03,766 --> 00:17:06,101
Let's go. Head home.

279
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,519
Stay back.

280
00:17:07,603 --> 00:17:09,438
We ain't doin' shit, man!

281
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,273
Get the fuck outta here.

282
00:17:11,315 --> 00:17:12,399
We didn't even fucking do shit!

283
00:17:12,483 --> 00:17:14,276
Start fuckin' walking.

284
00:17:15,194 --> 00:17:17,279
Hey. Hey. Head home!

285
00:17:17,988 --> 00:17:19,198
O'Shea.

286
00:17:20,908 --> 00:17:22,493
Fuck the police, homie!

287
00:17:24,411 --> 00:17:25,746
Get the fuck out of here!

288
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:27,790
Yo, this is bullshit!

289
00:17:37,091 --> 00:17:38,842
You really want to be here?

290
00:17:40,302 --> 00:17:42,346
This club full of Pirus.

291
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:44,014
We straight.

292
00:17:44,098 --> 00:17:46,058
Yeah, thanks for the tip, homie.

293
00:17:46,141 --> 00:17:47,518
These niggas.

294
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,660
I just wanna say this.
You should be a model.

295
00:18:04,785 --> 00:18:07,413
Yeah, you look like a model.

296
00:18:07,496 --> 00:18:09,373
Just sayin', you know.

297
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,418
I look in your eyes and I see a Capricorn.

298
00:18:12,501 --> 00:18:14,044
You're a Capricorn, right?

299
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:18,382
I mean, I can look at a girl
and I know their sign, you know?

300
00:18:19,508 --> 00:18:20,676
It's just something I do.

301
00:18:20,718 --> 00:18:22,469
Uh... Mmm-hmm.

302
00:18:23,304 --> 00:18:25,890
I hope I'm not
disrespecting you, right?

303
00:18:25,973 --> 00:18:27,558
- Uh-huh. Not at all.
- Good.

304
00:18:27,641 --> 00:18:28,767
- Yella!
- Good.

305
00:18:29,351 --> 00:18:30,728
Lonzo coming, man.

306
00:18:38,777 --> 00:18:40,571
- Nah, nah. <i>Weak at the Knees.
</i>-Huh?

307
00:18:40,654 --> 00:18:42,406
<i>Weak at the Knees.</i>

308
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,741
- Hey.
- Wassup?

309
00:18:43,824 --> 00:18:46,202
I'mma go outside and make sure
nothing's poppin' off, all right?

310
00:18:46,243 --> 00:18:47,995
I want you to keep these fat asses shakin'.

311
00:18:48,078 --> 00:18:50,247
Don't play none of that
street-ass rap shit, ar'ight?

312
00:18:50,331 --> 00:18:53,083
I want these motherfuckers
to think about pussy, not pistols.

313
00:18:54,043 --> 00:18:55,127
- Yella!
- Huh?

314
00:18:55,294 --> 00:18:56,670
I saw you talking to my lady, man.

315
00:18:56,795 --> 00:18:59,298
Keep your motherfuckin' hands to yourself.

316
00:18:59,381 --> 00:19:00,799
All right.

317
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:06,096
Man, why you always fuckin'
with Lonzo's girl, man?

318
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,598
Why not?

319
00:19:08,098 --> 00:19:10,434
I can't be afraid
of a grown man in high heels, Dre.

320
00:19:12,561 --> 00:19:14,688
Cube, you up.

321
00:19:16,815 --> 00:19:18,192
<i>Hey, yo, Compton!</i>

322
00:19:18,275 --> 00:19:19,652
<i>I got my little homie.</i>

323
00:19:19,735 --> 00:19:21,612
<i>He 'bout to come
and bust a little rhyme for y'all.</i>

324
00:19:21,654 --> 00:19:22,738
<i>I want y'all to give it up</i>

325
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:26,575
<i>for Ice-motherfuckin'-Cube!</i>

326
00:19:26,617 --> 00:19:28,857
<i>Here's a little
somethin' 'bout a nigga like me</i>

327
00:19:28,911 --> 00:19:31,622
<i>Never shoulda been let out the penitentiary</i>

328
00:19:31,705 --> 00:19:33,290
<i>Ice Cube would like to say</i>

329
00:19:33,332 --> 00:19:36,126
<i>That I'm a crazy mutherfucka
from around the way</i>

330
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:38,879
<i>Since I was a youth I smoked weed out</i>

331
00:19:38,963 --> 00:19:41,006
<i>Now I'm the mutherfucka that you read about</i>

332
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:42,299
<i>Takin' a life or two</i>

333
00:19:42,341 --> 00:19:43,634
<i>That's what the hell I do</i>

334
00:19:43,676 --> 00:19:46,011
<i>You don't like how I'm
livin' well, fuck you!</i>

335
00:19:46,095 --> 00:19:48,264
<i>This is a gang and I'm in it</i>

336
00:19:48,305 --> 00:19:50,349
<i>My man Dre'll fuck you up in a minute</i>

337
00:19:50,432 --> 00:19:51,517
<i>With a right left</i>

338
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,227
<i>Right, left you're toothless</i>

339
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,688
<i>And then you say goddamn they ruthless</i>

340
00:19:55,771 --> 00:19:58,023
<i>Everywhere we go they say damn!</i>

341
00:19:58,107 --> 00:20:00,442
<i>Ice Cube's fuckin' up the program</i>

342
00:20:00,484 --> 00:20:03,487
<i>And then you realize we don't care
We don't just say no</i>

343
00:20:03,529 --> 00:20:05,322
<i>We too busy sayin' yeah!</i>

344
00:20:05,364 --> 00:20:07,741
<i>About drinkin' straight
out the eight bottle</i>

345
00:20:07,825 --> 00:20:10,244
<i>Do I look like a motherfuckin' role model?</i>

346
00:20:10,327 --> 00:20:12,329
<i>To a kid lookin' up to me</i>

347
00:20:12,371 --> 00:20:14,665
<i>Life ain't nothin' but bitches and money</i>

348
00:20:14,707 --> 00:20:17,001
<i>'Cause I'm tha type of
nigga that's built to last</i>

349
00:20:17,042 --> 00:20:19,795
<i>If you fuck with me
I'll put my foot in your ass</i>

350
00:20:19,837 --> 00:20:22,590
<i>I don't give a fuck 'cause I keep bailin'</i>

351
00:20:22,673 --> 00:20:24,717
<i>Yo, what the fuck are they yellin'?</i>

352
00:20:29,638 --> 00:20:32,266
- Fucking right! I told you. I told you.
- Yes, you did.

353
00:20:38,439 --> 00:20:39,857
That's what I'm talking about, man.

354
00:20:40,357 --> 00:20:42,735
Now, see, I'm this close
to firing your monkey ass.

355
00:20:42,818 --> 00:20:44,987
What, you trying to start
a riot up in here?

356
00:20:45,029 --> 00:20:48,532
I told you. Didn't I tell you I don't want
that hardcore shit played in my club?

357
00:20:48,574 --> 00:20:50,659
As soon as I turn my back,
you do that shit anyway.

358
00:20:50,701 --> 00:20:52,912
I'm just trying to help
your business out, Lonzo.

359
00:20:52,995 --> 00:20:54,538
You saw they went crazy for that shit.

360
00:20:54,622 --> 00:20:55,873
Don't worry about my business, ar'ight?

361
00:20:55,956 --> 00:20:58,626
You just remember,
the only reason you up on that stage

362
00:20:58,709 --> 00:21:01,045
is 'cause I put you up
on that motherfuckin' stage.

363
00:21:01,086 --> 00:21:04,423
Now, you a badass DJ, I'll give you that,
but you don't like to listen, Dre.

364
00:21:04,506 --> 00:21:06,383
And I get tired of arguing all the time.

365
00:21:06,425 --> 00:21:08,219
'Cause you know,
there's a lot of cats that'll come in here

366
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:10,095
and they'll play exactly
what I want 'em to play.

367
00:21:10,179 --> 00:21:11,472
Like that shit right there.

368
00:21:11,555 --> 00:21:15,476
Cats that understand that you don't
bite the hand that feeds you.

369
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:17,561
Now you take a backseat
to that shit, nigga.

370
00:21:17,603 --> 00:21:19,563
These fucking marching jackets and shit.

371
00:21:19,647 --> 00:21:22,127
Marching my ass. You march
your ass and do what the fuck I say.

372
00:21:22,191 --> 00:21:23,984
Hey, Dre.

373
00:21:25,736 --> 00:21:27,571
Don't even trip on him, homie.

374
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:30,783
Nigga ain't got no fucking vision, man.

375
00:21:30,866 --> 00:21:33,410
That's why I'mma fuck his bitch.
After he leave.

376
00:21:33,494 --> 00:21:35,579
Not with that shit on.

377
00:21:37,498 --> 00:21:39,667
How you liking this little spot? Hey!

378
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:42,461
Dr. Dre.

379
00:21:42,545 --> 00:21:44,213
Wassup, E?

380
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:46,090
It's been a minute, man.

381
00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:48,759
I love your jacket, by the way.

382
00:21:49,051 --> 00:21:50,719
You baggin' on me.

383
00:21:50,761 --> 00:21:53,097
You know I don't like wearing this shit.

384
00:21:53,347 --> 00:21:55,933
That's Lonzo's shit, man.
You know it's part of the gig.

385
00:21:55,975 --> 00:21:58,602
Yeah. You remember
the homie Ren from Kelly Park, right?

386
00:21:58,894 --> 00:22:00,271
- Wassup?
- Wuddup, Dre?

387
00:22:00,312 --> 00:22:01,355
- Wuddup?
- Wassup, man?

388
00:22:01,438 --> 00:22:03,357
Look, I heard you been, um,

389
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,776
spending some time at your auntie's house.

390
00:22:06,193 --> 00:22:07,820
How's the couch life?

391
00:22:09,905 --> 00:22:10,948
It's fucked up.

392
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:12,449
I'm too tall for that shit.

393
00:22:12,491 --> 00:22:15,411
Plus I got my woman and baby livin' there.
It's hard, man.

394
00:22:15,578 --> 00:22:17,121
But you know,
everybody can't do what you do.

395
00:22:17,204 --> 00:22:19,582
Yeah, Dre. Well, what I do
gettin' played out quick, man.

396
00:22:19,623 --> 00:22:22,384
Motherfuckers just getting locked up
and laid down out here, you know?

397
00:22:22,418 --> 00:22:24,211
- Mmm-hmm.
- I gotta make some changes.

398
00:22:24,295 --> 00:22:25,963
Changes ain't bad.

399
00:22:26,005 --> 00:22:28,382
I'm thinking about
making a few changes myself.

400
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:29,967
Whatcha mean?

401
00:22:32,303 --> 00:22:34,972
Whatchu think about
dumping some money into this music shit?

402
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:37,099
Look, I got some ideas.

403
00:22:37,141 --> 00:22:38,392
<i>Let's give it up for Dr. Dre.</i>

404
00:22:38,475 --> 00:22:40,769
Fuck! I gotta get back up there.

405
00:22:40,811 --> 00:22:42,855
That's your calling, man.

406
00:22:42,938 --> 00:22:45,232
Tell Lonzo I said, "Fuck him." Ar'ight.

407
00:22:46,233 --> 00:22:47,401
Hey, E.

408
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:49,612
Think about it.

409
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,113
Ar'ight.

410
00:22:54,074 --> 00:22:55,075
Wassup? Do I know you?

411
00:22:55,159 --> 00:22:56,285
What?

412
00:22:56,327 --> 00:22:58,287
- Get 'em up.
- Hell no!

413
00:22:58,329 --> 00:23:00,623
Hey, don't be fuckin'
with my little brother, nigga!

414
00:23:00,664 --> 00:23:02,166
What the fuck did he do?

415
00:23:02,208 --> 00:23:04,668
Nigga lookin' at me
like he know me or somethin'.

416
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:06,837
Man, I told you about this shit!

417
00:23:06,879 --> 00:23:09,423
<i>- Clear the parking lot.
</i>-I told you to go the fuck home.

418
00:23:09,506 --> 00:23:10,841
The fuck wrong with you, man?

419
00:23:10,925 --> 00:23:12,885
You better chill the fuck out.

420
00:23:13,385 --> 00:23:14,595
One time.

421
00:23:17,389 --> 00:23:20,017
Hey! We told everybody
to clear this parking lot!

422
00:23:20,684 --> 00:23:22,102
We just standing here.

423
00:23:22,186 --> 00:23:23,187
Get outta here!

424
00:23:23,229 --> 00:23:24,230
What's going on?

425
00:23:24,313 --> 00:23:25,522
Hey! Head home.

426
00:23:25,606 --> 00:23:27,024
I fell.

427
00:23:27,524 --> 00:23:29,610
You fell? He fell?

428
00:23:30,694 --> 00:23:31,946
That's what he said.

429
00:23:32,029 --> 00:23:34,031
I didn't ask you what he said.

430
00:23:34,323 --> 00:23:35,824
Get the fuck home!

431
00:23:37,952 --> 00:23:39,370
I am home.

432
00:23:39,787 --> 00:23:41,914
Head home. Go!

433
00:23:45,543 --> 00:23:47,461
If you don't start walking...

434
00:23:49,463 --> 00:23:50,923
Or what?

435
00:23:51,006 --> 00:23:53,175
Turn around. Hands on your head.

436
00:23:53,842 --> 00:23:55,094
Come here.

437
00:23:58,556 --> 00:24:01,559
You have the right to remain silent.

438
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,061
Stop resisting, boy.

439
00:24:06,438 --> 00:24:08,399
You already know what it is.

440
00:24:26,667 --> 00:24:30,045
- What up, sucker-punch?
- You already know what it is.

441
00:24:30,504 --> 00:24:32,673
Sucker punched that dude, man.

442
00:24:32,756 --> 00:24:34,800
Hey, man, nah, nah, nah. That was Tyree.

443
00:24:34,884 --> 00:24:36,427
You know he got that temper and shit.

444
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,512
Always getting me into
fucking trouble, man.

445
00:24:38,596 --> 00:24:40,264
So what they lock you up for?

446
00:24:40,764 --> 00:24:44,435
I was literally just standing there, man.
That's it.

447
00:24:45,603 --> 00:24:46,770
As far as they was concerned.

448
00:24:46,854 --> 00:24:48,772
That's the gangsterist
shit I heard all week.

449
00:24:48,814 --> 00:24:50,858
Man, it's stupid.

450
00:24:51,442 --> 00:24:54,278
But I was thinking about what you
was saying last night, though, man.

451
00:24:54,361 --> 00:24:57,781
Oh, yeah? And?

452
00:24:58,782 --> 00:25:00,117
It's interesting.

453
00:25:00,201 --> 00:25:01,327
How long?

454
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:04,538
Really, like, how long do you think that shit
you doing out there gonna last?

455
00:25:04,622 --> 00:25:07,082
'Cause it ain't no happy endings
in that game, man.

456
00:25:07,458 --> 00:25:08,751
You saying a lot for a nigga

457
00:25:08,792 --> 00:25:10,753
who just got bailed outta jail.

458
00:25:11,128 --> 00:25:13,464
I'm just saying, if you can slang dope...

459
00:25:13,505 --> 00:25:15,007
- Nigga!
- What, man?

460
00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:17,099
Just tell the whole fuckin'
world I sell dope.

461
00:25:17,134 --> 00:25:20,846
Yo, yo. You can slang dope,
you can slang records, man. It's easy.

462
00:25:21,263 --> 00:25:23,224
You got a mind for that shit, E.

463
00:25:23,641 --> 00:25:25,809
So whatchu talking about doing?
Lil' homie from last night?

464
00:25:25,851 --> 00:25:27,811
Nah, man. He in a group.

465
00:25:27,853 --> 00:25:29,772
You know, they a trip, but...

466
00:25:30,731 --> 00:25:34,944
But that shit, the reality raps,
that's what I'm talking about, man.

467
00:25:34,985 --> 00:25:36,195
That's it.

468
00:25:36,278 --> 00:25:38,614
My boy, D.O.C.,
he coming in from Dallas, dope.

469
00:25:40,366 --> 00:25:41,909
My little homie, Ren, rap too.

470
00:25:41,992 --> 00:25:42,993
Oh, yeah?

471
00:25:43,035 --> 00:25:46,956
Hey, look, I got these cats,
H.B.O., Home Boys Only

472
00:25:46,997 --> 00:25:50,167
from New York, dope voices, man.

473
00:25:50,543 --> 00:25:51,961
Some whack-ass lyrics, though.

474
00:25:54,463 --> 00:25:57,841
I'm saying, Cube,
he wrote this shit for 'em, it's crazy.

475
00:25:58,676 --> 00:26:00,844
Shit, we could probably
do something with that.

476
00:26:01,178 --> 00:26:04,348
That's what I'm saying, man.
Start a label or something, man.

477
00:26:04,682 --> 00:26:05,849
A label?

478
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,935
That's kinda fucking far-fetched, Dre.

479
00:26:08,018 --> 00:26:09,853
Yeah, but check this out,

480
00:26:09,895 --> 00:26:12,189
what would you call a
record label like that?

481
00:26:19,196 --> 00:26:20,531
Ruthless.

482
00:26:20,864 --> 00:26:22,241
Ruthless?

483
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:27,580
- Just like these fucking police, nigga.
- Ruthless.

484
00:26:27,663 --> 00:26:30,499
Let's get the fuck from around here.
Trying to get me sent to jail.

485
00:26:30,541 --> 00:26:32,334
Get your simple ass in the car.

486
00:26:38,549 --> 00:26:41,552
<i>What the fuck is "gankin"?
And what's a "6-4"?</i>

487
00:26:41,635 --> 00:26:44,930
<i>- Yeah.
</i>-It's a car. A 6-4 Impala.

488
00:26:45,514 --> 00:26:47,725
"Ganking" is when you jack somebody, man.

489
00:26:47,808 --> 00:26:49,894
It's not a big deal.
The shit just sound better.

490
00:26:49,935 --> 00:26:52,855
<i>Yo, man, it's too much
cursing for radio play.</i>

491
00:26:52,897 --> 00:26:55,482
I mean, besides, who gives a fuck
about Compton anyway? Right?

492
00:26:55,566 --> 00:26:57,818
Hold the fuck up. Hey. Hold up, man.

493
00:27:00,321 --> 00:27:01,947
Hey, y'all got something
to say about Compton?

494
00:27:02,031 --> 00:27:04,074
'Cause we might have a problem
up in this bitch.

495
00:27:07,036 --> 00:27:08,037
Huh!

496
00:27:08,162 --> 00:27:10,873
<i>No? Then do the lyrics,</i>

497
00:27:10,915 --> 00:27:13,459
<i>'cause I'm really losing my patience,
ar'ight?</i>

498
00:27:13,542 --> 00:27:15,169
Stop fucking embarrassing me, man.

499
00:27:15,252 --> 00:27:16,545
<i>Hey, man. I ain't with this shit.</i>

500
00:27:16,587 --> 00:27:17,630
Yeah, man. Fuck this shit.

501
00:27:17,713 --> 00:27:20,007
- Fuck this Jheri curl rap bullshit, man.
- Where y'all going?

502
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:23,135
Fuck you! Wearing a Kangol
don't make you LL Cool J, nigga.

503
00:27:23,219 --> 00:27:25,596
What the fuck you gonna do about it?
Whatcha gonna do, mark-ass nigga?

504
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:26,680
Hey.

505
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,863
Let's roll, B.

506
00:27:46,408 --> 00:27:47,618
B-street-looking motherfucker.

507
00:27:47,701 --> 00:27:48,953
Fucking Jheri curl ass.

508
00:27:48,994 --> 00:27:51,664
Keep talkin' that bullshit
on your way out the door, nigga.

509
00:28:00,381 --> 00:28:01,590
Well, there goes the talent, Dre.

510
00:28:01,632 --> 00:28:02,800
Shut the fuck up, E.

511
00:28:03,801 --> 00:28:05,970
- I'm saying...
- Come on, man.

512
00:28:06,011 --> 00:28:08,973
How the fuck we suppose
to make a record label and hit records

513
00:28:09,056 --> 00:28:10,724
and we ain't got no talent?

514
00:28:11,809 --> 00:28:15,271
I mean, you said, hold up my side of the deal.
You said, put some money up.

515
00:28:16,063 --> 00:28:18,023
So, it's time for you to deliver.

516
00:28:23,612 --> 00:28:25,531
Why don't you do this shit, E?

517
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:28,075
Nah, for real.
Get in there on the mic.

518
00:28:28,158 --> 00:28:31,829
You ain't got shit to lose.
It's your money. You paying for it.

519
00:28:31,912 --> 00:28:35,541
No, I can't. 'Cause I'm not a rapper.
There's your rapper.

520
00:28:35,624 --> 00:28:36,917
I'm in a group already, man.

521
00:28:37,001 --> 00:28:39,128
Jinx and them
would trip on me if I do anything.

522
00:28:39,169 --> 00:28:41,672
Look, I understand
that you wanna keep throwing your life away

523
00:28:41,714 --> 00:28:43,883
with Jinx and the backyard
boogie band or whatever...

524
00:28:43,966 --> 00:28:46,176
But I'm the Berry Gordy of this shit.

525
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:49,096
So, whenever y'all figure out
what y'all wanna do,

526
00:28:49,179 --> 00:28:50,306
just let me know.

527
00:28:51,015 --> 00:28:54,184
Come on, man.
Look, the song is about you, E.

528
00:28:54,226 --> 00:28:57,187
Eazy-motherfuckin'-E. I'm telling you.

529
00:28:57,354 --> 00:28:59,398
Come on, man.

530
00:28:59,481 --> 00:29:00,983
You the only muthafucka with a 6-4.

531
00:29:01,025 --> 00:29:03,027
- You got a 6-4?
- I don't have a car.

532
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:04,194
You got a 6-4?

533
00:29:04,236 --> 00:29:05,237
I got a po' Porsche, man.

534
00:29:05,321 --> 00:29:06,906
Nigga, come on, man.

535
00:29:08,198 --> 00:29:09,575
You ain't doing nothing.

536
00:29:12,203 --> 00:29:14,705
But you the business man,
so, you know.

537
00:29:14,872 --> 00:29:16,207
It's on you.

538
00:29:16,916 --> 00:29:18,959
We got a cool-ass song, though.

539
00:29:20,044 --> 00:29:21,879
I think you could hit that shit.

540
00:29:24,924 --> 00:29:26,342
I'm not sold, Dre.

541
00:29:26,383 --> 00:29:28,802
Whatchu mean, you not sold?
You just gonna sit there?

542
00:29:29,553 --> 00:29:31,680
You're kinda being a ho right now, Eric.

543
00:29:34,975 --> 00:29:37,019
Fuck y'all, niggas.

544
00:29:37,061 --> 00:29:38,729
Berry Gordy to save the day.

545
00:29:38,771 --> 00:29:39,772
I ain't scared.

546
00:29:39,855 --> 00:29:41,440
- You ain't scared?
- What's up then?

547
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:43,525
<i>What are you doing?</i>

548
00:29:43,567 --> 00:29:46,278
E, let me produce. Man.

549
00:29:47,905 --> 00:29:49,198
<i>Feel like it's getting weird.</i>

550
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,075
Man, shut up and get comfortable.

551
00:29:51,575 --> 00:29:52,743
Let's go.

552
00:29:55,538 --> 00:29:58,249
<i>Cruisin' down the street in my 6-4</i>

553
00:29:58,916 --> 00:30:00,042
Shit.

554
00:30:00,084 --> 00:30:01,252
The fuck?

555
00:30:04,588 --> 00:30:06,632
<i>What the fuck is so funny?</i>

556
00:30:06,715 --> 00:30:08,717
<i>Nothing. Oh, E, can you hear me?</i>

557
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:11,762
Yeah, I can hear you
and how much y'all fucking laughing.

558
00:30:11,804 --> 00:30:15,349
<i>Hey, E, you good.
Just hit that first beat hard, man.</i>

559
00:30:15,432 --> 00:30:17,226
You gotta come in on beat.

560
00:30:17,268 --> 00:30:18,769
<i>Cruisin' down the street</i>

561
00:30:18,852 --> 00:30:20,479
You cruisin'.

562
00:30:20,563 --> 00:30:22,273
- You good, Eric.
- All right?

563
00:30:22,314 --> 00:30:24,066
No, no, no, no. You good, you good.

564
00:30:24,108 --> 00:30:27,111
It's dope. But on beat.

565
00:30:27,152 --> 00:30:29,446
Again. All right? Let's go.

566
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:31,532
You cruising. All right?

567
00:30:37,955 --> 00:30:40,499
<i>Cruisin' down the street in my 6-4</i>

568
00:30:40,958 --> 00:30:42,710
<i>- Shit.
- That ain't it.</i>

569
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,503
<i>- It really ain't.
</i>-Hey, hey, Dre.

570
00:30:44,587 --> 00:30:47,047
He gotta go if we're gonna do this.
Cube, you gotta go.

571
00:30:47,131 --> 00:30:48,371
<i>Get the fuck outta here, Yella.</i>

572
00:30:48,424 --> 00:30:49,842
<i>- He not talkin' to me.
</i>-Nah, nigga, both of y'all.

573
00:30:49,925 --> 00:30:50,968
<i>You talking to me?</i>

574
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:52,344
<i>- Bye.
</i>-Go, Cube.

575
00:30:52,428 --> 00:30:53,804
- And Yella, get the fuck outta here, man.
- Me too?

576
00:30:53,846 --> 00:30:54,972
Yeah, so we can get this shit done.

577
00:30:55,014 --> 00:30:57,892
Write the song, Cube.
Shut the fuck up, Cube.

578
00:30:57,975 --> 00:31:00,019
<i>- Take these with you, Cube.
</i>-What'd I do?

579
00:31:00,102 --> 00:31:02,187
- For real?
- Yes, man. Come on.

580
00:31:02,271 --> 00:31:04,523
You know what? Whatever. Whatever.

581
00:31:05,983 --> 00:31:07,318
You motherfucker.

582
00:31:07,401 --> 00:31:08,694
<i>- Come on, E.
</i>-You finished, Dre?

583
00:31:08,777 --> 00:31:11,655
<i>You wanna laugh too?
I stay in this bitch by myself.</i>

584
00:31:11,697 --> 00:31:12,865
Hey, just say the words, ar'ight?

585
00:31:12,948 --> 00:31:13,991
What does that even mean?

586
00:31:14,074 --> 00:31:16,535
<i>Man, just say the shit with me.
Ar'ight? Cruisin'.</i>

587
00:31:16,619 --> 00:31:17,620
<i>Cruisin'.</i>

588
00:31:17,661 --> 00:31:19,622
<i>Yeah, "Cruisin'". Let's go.</i>

589
00:31:25,002 --> 00:31:28,047
<i>Dre, you know this shit
ain't gonna never work</i>

590
00:31:28,881 --> 00:31:30,883
A'ight. You trying to be funny.

591
00:31:30,966 --> 00:31:33,219
But, you see how you said that shit, right?
Like you believe it.

592
00:31:33,302 --> 00:31:34,428
<i>Yeah, I believe that shit.</i>

593
00:31:34,511 --> 00:31:36,388
Then say this shit like
you believe it, man.

594
00:31:36,472 --> 00:31:38,182
<i>Like it's a motherfuckin' Sunday</i>

595
00:31:38,224 --> 00:31:41,101
and you cruisin' down Crenshaw
in a motherfuckin' 6-4.

596
00:31:41,185 --> 00:31:44,021
<i>Come on. Say that shit like you believe it,
man, like it's your words.</i>

597
00:31:44,104 --> 00:31:45,189
<i>Feel that shit.</i>

598
00:31:45,272 --> 00:31:47,024
<i>Stop playing around. Loosen the fuck up.</i>

599
00:31:47,066 --> 00:31:48,192
<i>There you go.</i>

600
00:31:54,406 --> 00:31:57,076
<i>Cruisin' down the street in my 6-4</i>

601
00:31:57,159 --> 00:32:00,538
<i>Oh, shit. Hey, that was dope, E.</i>

602
00:32:00,621 --> 00:32:03,499
That shit was dope, man. Yeah.

603
00:32:03,541 --> 00:32:05,960
<i>That's what I'm talking about, man.</i>

604
00:32:06,043 --> 00:32:07,920
<i>You feelin' that shit, right?</i>

605
00:32:08,003 --> 00:32:11,465
Now we only got 59 more lines
to punch in, but it's all good.

606
00:32:11,549 --> 00:32:14,176
<i>We gonna get through it.
Let's go on to the next one.</i>

607
00:32:30,067 --> 00:32:31,485
<i>My man didn't budge</i>

608
00:32:31,569 --> 00:32:34,029
<i>Bailiff came over to turn him in</i>

609
00:32:34,071 --> 00:32:37,116
<i>Kilo G looked up and gave a grin</i>

610
00:32:37,199 --> 00:32:39,660
<i>He yelled out "fire!" then came Suzy</i>

611
00:32:39,743 --> 00:32:42,413
<i>The bitch came in with a submachine Uzi</i>

612
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:45,249
<i>Police shot the girl but didn't hurt her</i>

613
00:32:45,332 --> 00:32:47,668
<i>Both upstate for attempted murder</i>

614
00:32:47,751 --> 00:32:50,421
<i>'Cause the boyz n tha hood are always hard</i>

615
00:32:50,462 --> 00:32:53,007
<i>You come talking that trash
we'll pull your card</i>

616
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:55,759
<i>Knowing nothing in life but to be legit</i>

617
00:32:55,801 --> 00:32:58,637
<i>Don't quote me,
boy 'cause I ain't said shit</i>

618
00:33:02,766 --> 00:33:03,893
Yes.

619
00:33:03,934 --> 00:33:05,102
All right, Eazy.

620
00:33:05,227 --> 00:33:06,645
Hell yes, Dre!

621
00:33:06,729 --> 00:33:08,105
- Yeah?
- Yes.

622
00:33:08,188 --> 00:33:09,607
Hey, D.O.C.

623
00:33:10,941 --> 00:33:12,026
Whatchu think, man?

624
00:33:12,109 --> 00:33:13,777
You think they gonna feel

625
00:33:13,861 --> 00:33:16,655
Man, to be honest, man,
that shit is super dope, nigga.

626
00:33:16,739 --> 00:33:18,574
- Hell yeah!
- For real, nigga.

627
00:33:18,616 --> 00:33:21,619
Hey, Lonzo. Whatchu think?

628
00:33:23,537 --> 00:33:25,456
Sound like some waste-of-time shit to me.

629
00:33:25,831 --> 00:33:28,083
Look, trust me, this shit
ain't gonna work, ar'ight?

630
00:33:28,125 --> 00:33:30,002
You ain't gonna get no radio play
with that shit right there.

631
00:33:30,085 --> 00:33:31,879
- Oh, for real?
- Oh, for very real.

632
00:33:31,962 --> 00:33:33,297
Y'all need to wrap this shit up too

633
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,716
'cause I need you to get back
on that slow jam that we talked about.

634
00:33:35,799 --> 00:33:38,552
This whole reality of rap
shit y'all tryin' to do.

635
00:33:38,636 --> 00:33:41,138
Talkin' about low-riders and jail,
nobody wanna hear that shit.

636
00:33:41,222 --> 00:33:44,225
Now you need to get back in there
and work on that slow jam that we worked on.

637
00:33:44,308 --> 00:33:45,309
And I'm serious

638
00:33:45,392 --> 00:33:48,520
about all you motherfuckers taking up
my time and that's coming outta your pay.

639
00:33:48,604 --> 00:33:50,648
No disrespect, Eazy,
'cause I know you real.

640
00:33:50,731 --> 00:33:52,900
But you, motherfucker,
I ain't gonna take that shit from you.

641
00:33:52,983 --> 00:33:54,944
20 years from now,
you gonna fucking thank me. Watch.

642
00:33:54,985 --> 00:33:56,705
Nigga, 20 years
from now, you still gonna be

643
00:33:56,779 --> 00:33:59,114
recording love songs
in this dusty-ass garage.

644
00:34:00,324 --> 00:34:01,367
Fuck outta here.

645
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:03,869
Wrap this shit up.

646
00:34:04,662 --> 00:34:06,664
Yeah. Okay. You got it.

647
00:34:06,747 --> 00:34:08,165
No, you got it!

648
00:34:12,294 --> 00:34:13,837
- Yes!
- I told you. Didn't I tell you?

649
00:34:13,921 --> 00:34:15,506
You told me, man. I should've believed you.

650
00:34:15,589 --> 00:34:18,469
What the fuck did you all get from that
that you're high-fiving and shit?

651
00:34:18,842 --> 00:34:21,178
Cube. Man, if Lonzo think
it ain't gonna be shit,

652
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:22,888
we know we got a motherfucking hit!

653
00:34:22,972 --> 00:34:24,348
- Exactly.
- For real.

654
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:25,391
'Cause he don't know shit about music.

655
00:34:25,516 --> 00:34:27,556
He don't know good music
when he hears it.

656
00:34:27,601 --> 00:34:28,936
Play that shit again!

657
00:34:29,019 --> 00:34:30,062
Dre...

658
00:34:30,145 --> 00:34:33,190
You a fucking genius. You a fucking genius.

659

These phones are burning up.

This is 1580 KDAY.

This is Greg Mack with the Mack Attack,

00:35:26,744 --> 00:35:28,996
and I gotta give it up to my boy, Dr. Dre,

679
00:35:44,553 --> 00:35:45,596
Excuse me.

680
00:35:45,638 --> 00:35:47,932
- Yeah?
- I heard your record.

681
00:35:49,141 --> 00:35:50,601
I'm Jerry Heller.

682
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,186
Eric Wright.

683
00:35:52,269 --> 00:35:54,438
Real pleasure to meet you, man.

684
00:35:54,521 --> 00:35:55,648
Same here.

685
00:35:55,731 --> 00:35:56,899
Uh, would it...

686
00:35:57,775 --> 00:36:00,903
Here, let me get those for you.
Let me get those for you.

687
00:36:00,945 --> 00:36:04,782
Would it be possible
to have a word with you for a second, Eric?

688
00:36:04,865 --> 00:36:06,116
About what?

689
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:08,244
About music.

690
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:11,497
After you.

691
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,457
All right. Come on.

692
00:36:19,964 --> 00:36:22,132
So, I thought your album was good, man.

693
00:36:22,174 --> 00:36:23,300
Just good?

694
00:36:23,467 --> 00:36:24,593
Mmm.

695
00:36:27,721 --> 00:36:29,348
Hey, hey, hey, hey! No.

696
00:36:29,431 --> 00:36:31,058
I thought it was exceptional.

697
00:36:31,725 --> 00:36:32,810
- Exceptional?
- Yes.

698
00:36:32,851 --> 00:36:35,479
Fantastic.
Please, just sit down, all right?

699
00:36:35,563 --> 00:36:37,898
We'll start this again. Come on.

700
00:36:38,399 --> 00:36:43,571
All right. I'm gonna try this again. Okay?

701
00:36:43,654 --> 00:36:44,989
All right.

702
00:36:47,116 --> 00:36:50,327
As a music manager,
let me tell you what I can do for you, Eric.

703
00:36:50,452 --> 00:36:52,872
I will make you legit.

704
00:36:52,955 --> 00:36:56,792
It seems as if I could
do something for you.

705
00:36:59,962 --> 00:37:02,631
I see. You think because
I don't have some flashy office

706
00:37:02,673 --> 00:37:04,174
I don't know what I'm talking about?

707
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:07,803
I worked with Elton John.
I worked with Otis Redding.

708
00:37:07,845 --> 00:37:12,808
Let me see.
I worked with War. I worked with Styx.

709
00:37:12,933 --> 00:37:16,979
- I worked with, uh...
- Have you worked with anybody this decade?

710
00:37:18,606 --> 00:37:20,232
Okay.

711
00:37:21,191 --> 00:37:23,861
Let me tell you what I see here, Eric.

712
00:37:25,195 --> 00:37:29,700
A lot of raw talent, a lot of braggadocio.

713
00:37:29,992 --> 00:37:31,493
Bravado. Uh...

714
00:37:31,535 --> 00:37:33,662
But if you think anyone's
gonna talk to you,

715
00:37:33,704 --> 00:37:36,081
you think anyone
is gonna let you in the building

716
00:37:36,165 --> 00:37:39,293
where somebody might listen to you or talk
to you, you think that's gonna happen?

717
00:37:39,376 --> 00:37:41,962
You're crazy, man. I'm sorry.

718
00:37:42,796 --> 00:37:44,548
That is what I can do for you.

719
00:37:44,965 --> 00:37:46,842
I can make you legit.

720
00:37:47,301 --> 00:37:50,888
I can get you in that building.
And I will protect you.

721
00:37:50,971 --> 00:37:54,892
I will block out all the noise
of this crazy fuckin' business

722
00:37:55,059 --> 00:37:56,894
and we can build something big.

723
00:37:57,394 --> 00:38:00,856
But you gotta believe in me
the way that I believe in you.

724
00:38:01,398 --> 00:38:03,192
The way that I believe in this,

725
00:38:03,234 --> 00:38:05,819
because you have a unique talent, Eric.

726
00:38:05,903 --> 00:38:07,071
Very special.

727
00:38:07,154 --> 00:38:08,864
Don't fuck around.

728
00:38:10,658 --> 00:38:12,618
But, you know what?

729
00:38:14,411 --> 00:38:15,871
If you can't handle it,

730
00:38:15,913 --> 00:38:19,166
if it's too much fuckin' pressure
for you, then fine.

731
00:38:19,917 --> 00:38:21,252
Get outta here.

732
00:38:21,418 --> 00:38:24,630
Wait. I'm listening.

733
00:38:29,718 --> 00:38:31,720
You got more music for me?

734
00:38:35,015 --> 00:38:36,392
- Absolutely.
- Good.

735
00:38:36,934 --> 00:38:41,730
'Cause you are gonna
have to follow this up, quick. All right?

736
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:44,942
Now, what does N.W.A stand for, huh?

737
00:38:45,859 --> 00:38:48,779
No Whites Allowed? Something like that?

738
00:38:48,862 --> 00:38:50,072
Nah.

739
00:38:51,156 --> 00:38:52,700
Niggas With Attitudes.

740
00:38:57,204 --> 00:38:58,497
You're fucking kidding me.

741
00:39:02,751 --> 00:39:05,254
All right. We can work with that.

742
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:09,925
- Good. I like that. I like that a lot.
- You better.

743
00:39:13,429 --> 00:39:14,805
Fantastic.

744
00:39:15,514 --> 00:39:16,974
Fantastic.

745
00:39:40,456 --> 00:39:42,917
What up, what up? What's up, fam?

746
00:39:47,838 --> 00:39:49,131
- Hey.
- What's up, baby?

747
00:39:49,215 --> 00:39:50,674
Dre.

748
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:58,015
Hey, fellas, y'all got any idea

749
00:39:58,098 --> 00:40:00,017
why I asked y'all to
wear all black tonight?

750
00:40:00,142 --> 00:40:01,560
'Cause we a all-star group.

751
00:40:01,644 --> 00:40:03,354
And to be a all-star group

752
00:40:03,395 --> 00:40:04,855
we gotta look like it,

753
00:40:04,897 --> 00:40:07,858
sound like it, dress like it.

754
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:10,236
You mind tellin' me
what the fuck happened in your situation?

755
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:12,696
Man, kiss my ass.
This the only clean shit I had left.

756
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,300
That's saying a lot
about how you live.

757
00:40:14,365 --> 00:40:15,885
Are we getting paid to wear all black?

758
00:40:17,868 --> 00:40:21,205
Look, I ain't lookin' out for your ass
no more, man. Put this on.

759
00:40:22,414 --> 00:40:24,583
Oh, shit, there go Mr. Drummond.

760
00:40:24,667 --> 00:40:26,460
Nah, nah. That's Mr. Furley

761
00:40:26,544 --> 00:40:27,836
from <i>Three's Company.</i>

762
00:40:27,878 --> 00:40:29,505
Hey, that's good, Ren.

763
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,176
Y'all finished?

764
00:40:34,468 --> 00:40:37,263
This man been out there
shopping our stuff around

765
00:40:37,513 --> 00:40:39,098
trying to get money for Ruthless.

766
00:40:39,181 --> 00:40:40,724
He tryin' to get us distribution.

767
00:40:40,766 --> 00:40:42,101
He tryin' to get us on tour.

768
00:40:42,184 --> 00:40:43,185
He could probably bring some real money

769
00:40:43,227 --> 00:40:44,228
- to the table...
- Okay.

770
00:40:44,311 --> 00:40:45,312
- So let's take this shit serious.
- Okay.

771
00:40:45,396 --> 00:40:46,397
And then what, E?

772
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:50,734
All he do is take 20 off the top.
We cut 80, but that's how managers work.

773
00:40:50,776 --> 00:40:54,154
Fellas, all right. I'm sorry I'm late.
How's everybody doing?

774
00:40:54,822 --> 00:40:57,867
I'm gonna be honest with you.
We've had a lot of passes.

775
00:40:58,367 --> 00:41:01,078
Uh, people are scared of you guys.
Big time.

776
00:41:01,161 --> 00:41:03,038
They think that you're dangerous.

777
00:41:03,122 --> 00:41:05,583
Uh, I happen to think
that that's a good thing.

778
00:41:05,666 --> 00:41:07,960
These fucking guys,
they need some more convincing.

779
00:41:08,043 --> 00:41:11,714
They're so fucking timid.
So I invited them here to the show.

780
00:41:11,755 --> 00:41:15,134
So you've got to kick ass tonight.

781
00:41:15,467 --> 00:41:17,094
- Can you do that?
- Hell yeah.

782
00:41:17,177 --> 00:41:19,430
They're gonna be here.
Scare the shit out of them.

783
00:41:20,931 --> 00:41:22,600
Blow the fucking roof off, all right?

784
00:41:22,683 --> 00:41:23,726
Have a good show.

785
00:41:23,767 --> 00:41:25,144
Hey, can this motherfucker

786
00:41:25,227 --> 00:41:27,062
Jerry Heller bring in more pussy?

787
00:41:27,104 --> 00:41:28,544
'Cause that shit's worth 20 percent.

Jerry, you're my friend,

843
00:44:06,597 --> 00:44:10,601
but Compton? I don't think so.
Queens, maybe.

844
00:44:10,643 --> 00:44:14,355
Listen, if you find
the next Bon Jovi, call me, okay?

845
00:44:14,438 --> 00:44:15,718
- Good luck.

You wrecked
these motherfuckers tonight, boy.

00:44:40,589 --> 00:44:44,385
The stage was shaking so much I thought
my needle's about to jump off the record!

856
00:44:46,554 --> 00:44:50,140
Yo, I was trippin' off them knowing the words,
though. That shit was crazy.

857
00:44:50,182 --> 00:44:53,435
Hey, y'all, I'm telling you,
Compton is definitely on the map, yo.

858
00:44:53,477 --> 00:44:56,105
- Damn right.
- That's for damn sure.

859
00:44:56,146 --> 00:44:59,483
Man, I figured you were gonna represent
tonight. Good shit, my nigga.

Wuddup? Whatchu been up to?
You still out there in Vegas?

862
00:45:04,238 --> 00:45:07,491
Man, I just been back and forth, man.
Doing some security bodyguard work.

863
00:45:08,367 --> 00:45:10,077
If y'all need my services, let me know.

864
00:45:11,036 --> 00:45:12,204
Security?

865
00:45:12,288 --> 00:45:14,039
I don't think we gonna need
no bodyguards, man.

866
00:45:14,123 --> 00:45:15,666
We might got that covered.

867
00:45:18,335 --> 00:45:20,337
But you never know
what you need until you need it.

868
00:45:24,174 --> 00:45:27,177
Look, I just came here to give y'all props.
I got people waiting on me.

869
00:45:28,512 --> 00:45:30,556
Excuse me.

870
00:45:30,890 --> 00:45:32,433
Uh, okay. That was

871
00:45:33,392 --> 00:45:35,269
one hell of a show.

872
00:45:36,145 --> 00:45:37,605
Nice job.

873
00:45:37,688 --> 00:45:39,857
Very, very nice, gentlemen. Outstanding!

874
00:45:40,649 --> 00:45:44,069
You kicked ass, yeah.
You definitely did. You definitely did.

875
00:45:44,528 --> 00:45:48,699
Okay, this is Eazy-E and N.W.A, obviously.

876
00:45:48,908 --> 00:45:50,409
Guys, this is Bryan Turner.

877
00:45:50,993 --> 00:45:52,313

879
00:45:56,165 --> 00:45:57,875
And he wants to sign you.

880
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,543
Yeah, immediately.

881
00:46:00,085 --> 00:46:02,588
Fellas, I got to say, I loved the show.
All right?

882
00:46:02,671 --> 00:46:06,383
What you did with that crowd out there,
I mean, I've never seen anything like that.

883
00:46:06,592 --> 00:46:09,762
So, I think, honestly,
if y'all wanted to, you guys

884
00:46:09,845 --> 00:46:11,847
- would fit perfectly with our label.
- Yes.

885
00:46:11,889 --> 00:46:13,265
That'll work.

886
00:46:13,349 --> 00:46:15,017
Nah, nah, nah, nah. No, it won't. Nah.

887
00:46:15,059 --> 00:46:17,853
Well, hold on, man.
I mean, Priority Records.

888
00:46:18,312 --> 00:46:20,112
I've never heard of it.
I mean, what you got?

889
00:46:20,189 --> 00:46:23,567
Like, is it Def Jam?
Like, the Beastie Boys? You know?

890
00:46:23,776 --> 00:46:26,570
Run DMC? You know what I'm saying?

891
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:29,073
Or is it more R&B?

892
00:46:29,156 --> 00:46:31,242
You know, Prince, Michael Jackson.

893
00:46:31,283 --> 00:46:33,118
- It's, uh, a little more...
- More that end of the spectrum.

894
00:46:33,202 --> 00:46:35,162
- More R&B as of right now, but...
- Yeah.

895
00:46:35,246 --> 00:46:37,248
Yeah, we represent nothing big,

896
00:46:37,373 --> 00:46:38,582
but mostly R&B.

897
00:46:38,666 --> 00:46:39,959
Who dat?

898
00:46:40,042 --> 00:46:41,669
It's, uh, California Raisins.

899
00:46:42,002 --> 00:46:43,295
Who?

900
00:46:43,379 --> 00:46:45,047
It's the California Raisins.

901
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:47,258
The raisins from the commercial singing

902
00:46:47,341 --> 00:46:49,101
"I Heard it Through the
Grapevine" and shit?

903
00:46:49,134 --> 00:46:50,928
Yes, Cube, the little-ass raisins.

904
00:46:51,428 --> 00:46:53,138
That would be the one.

905
00:46:53,222 --> 00:46:55,307
Hear it out.
Don't get ahead of yourselves, okay?

906
00:46:55,391 --> 00:46:59,019
I was laughing, too,
I promise, then I started cashing checks.

907
00:46:59,603 --> 00:47:03,774
So, look, I gotta tell ya,
those little fuckers, they went gold last year.

908
00:47:04,441 --> 00:47:06,735
- Gold?
- Almost platinum. Yeah.

909
00:47:07,152 --> 00:47:09,947
What do you say, fellas?
You wanna go make a record?

910
00:47:13,117 --> 00:47:14,618
I mean...

911
00:47:14,702 --> 00:47:16,453
- Yeah!

912
00:47:19,707 --> 00:47:21,792

913
00:47:21,876 --> 00:47:24,295
He seriously dug it. He really dug it.

914
00:47:24,336 --> 00:47:25,921

- He did.

915
00:47:25,963 --> 00:47:27,163
- Thank you, man.
- You did it.

916
00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:36,891
A'ight, so, look, your rhymes ain't tight,
it ain't makin' the record.

917
00:47:36,974 --> 00:47:39,727
This ain't Lonzo's shit,
this the real deal. Ar'ight?

918
00:47:40,102 --> 00:47:42,146
So your shit better be dope. Who up?

00:47:47,484 --> 00:47:49,069
All right. Let's see.

Hey, Yella. Play that shit.

<i>That you step and do your dance routine
It ain't a dream, my man</i>

<i>And for this reason I'm a walkin' threat</i>

933
00:48:12,801 --> 00:48:14,053

<i>And now I'm livin' in
correctional facilities</i>

938
00:48:25,272 --> 00:48:30,402
<i>'Cause some don't agree with how I do this
I get straight meditate like a Buddhist</i>

939
00:48:30,527 --> 00:48:32,279
<i>Express yourself</i>

940
00:48:34,490 --> 00:48:36,659
<i>Express yourself</i>

941
00:48:40,037 --> 00:48:41,372
<i>N.W.A take two</i>

942
00:48:45,793 --> 00:48:47,336
Yeah!

943
00:48:47,378 --> 00:48:49,088
Hell yeah, Dre.

944
00:48:49,171 --> 00:48:51,048
Yeah, man!

945
00:48:51,257 --> 00:48:53,551
You feel that shit, right? Hey, check this out.

946
00:48:53,717 --> 00:48:54,885
Fuck it up.

947
00:48:56,887 --> 00:48:58,055
Yeah.

948
00:48:58,097 --> 00:49:00,683
That's what I'm talking about, man.
But you hear the difference, right?

949
00:49:00,724 --> 00:49:02,726
Yeah, way better than the shit
I came up with.

950
00:49:02,768 --> 00:49:05,062
- I know.
- Fuck you.

951
00:49:05,896 --> 00:49:08,399
Excuse me, gentlemen.
I thought you'd like to know

952
00:49:08,732 --> 00:49:10,859
our deal with Priority Records is done.

953
00:49:11,068 --> 00:49:13,571
- Yes! That's whassup, man!
- Money!

954
00:49:13,654 --> 00:49:15,614
Contracts right here for you to sign.

955
00:49:15,781 --> 00:49:17,783
- Thank you, my good man.
- Music keep sounding like this,

956
00:49:17,867 --> 00:49:19,660
this album is gonna be incredible.

957
00:49:19,743 --> 00:49:21,370
Well, you're welcome, Jerry.

958
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:25,249
Very strong lyrics too, Cube. Very strong.

959
00:49:25,583 --> 00:49:27,084
- Appreciate that, Jerry.
- Mmm-hmm.

960
00:49:27,167 --> 00:49:28,836
So what's up with our contracts, though?

961
00:49:30,129 --> 00:49:32,449
They're getting done right now.
Lawyers are drawing 'em up.

962
00:49:32,506 --> 00:49:34,842
Jerry on top of that,
but did you just switch all the straws?

963
00:49:34,925 --> 00:49:37,845
Yo, Dre. There's something outside
you need to take care of.

964
00:49:38,262 --> 00:49:39,972
Right now. Trust me.

965
00:49:43,225 --> 00:49:45,269
Serious.

966
00:49:45,769 --> 00:49:47,479
Uh-oh. Really?

967
00:49:48,272 --> 00:49:51,233
- We can split that.
- Cube. Right there, hush.

968
00:49:52,192 --> 00:49:55,404
- Not this time.
- You know what I got for you.

969
00:49:55,779 --> 00:49:58,866
So let me get this straight.
You gonna do this right here, right now?

970
00:49:59,074 --> 00:50:00,618
What am I supposed to do?

971
00:50:00,701 --> 00:50:02,870
We're sleeping in a twin bed
at your auntie's house.

972
00:50:02,953 --> 00:50:04,663
We have a baby, Andre.

973
00:50:04,747 --> 00:50:06,457
You expect me to wait
for what you doin' in there?

974
00:50:06,624 --> 00:50:08,292
And you in the streets fuckin' around?

975
00:50:08,375 --> 00:50:10,127
- Are you crazy?
- What?

976
00:50:10,211 --> 00:50:11,670
I'm out here bustin' my fuckin' ass

977
00:50:11,754 --> 00:50:14,006
day and fuckin' night
tryin' to create something.

978
00:50:14,089 --> 00:50:16,800
You gonna come up in here talkin' about
some fuckin' bitches? Are you crazy?

979
00:50:16,884 --> 00:50:19,386
- You don't get it.
- No, you don't get it, Lavetta.

980
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:20,512
Daddy!

981
00:50:20,596 --> 00:50:22,014
It's all right, baby.

982
00:50:22,097 --> 00:50:23,807
Chill out, man.

983
00:50:27,478 --> 00:50:29,396
Tyra, it's gonna be okay. All right.

984
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,023
- All right, baby?
- Bye, Dre.

985
00:50:31,106 --> 00:50:32,650
Daddy love you.

986
00:50:42,284 --> 00:50:44,745
- You cool?
- Fuck no, man. I'm far from cool.

987
00:50:44,828 --> 00:50:46,997
- What happened, Dre? What she say?
- What'd you do?

988
00:50:47,331 --> 00:50:49,375
Shit! Here we go again.

989
00:50:49,583 --> 00:50:51,460
Shit. One time, one time.

990
00:50:52,336 --> 00:50:55,256
We cool. We ain't even doin' shit.
We not doin' shit.

991
00:50:55,881 --> 00:50:57,800
You guys lost?

992
00:50:58,050 --> 00:50:59,093
Nah.

993
00:50:59,176 --> 00:51:01,053
You niggas supposed to be somewhere?

994
00:51:01,762 --> 00:51:04,098
Yeah! Here. We working.

995
00:51:04,223 --> 00:51:05,641
Oh, you working?

996
00:51:06,225 --> 00:51:07,476
Yeah, I bet.

997
00:51:07,601 --> 00:51:10,229
- What we do?
- We'll find out in a minute what you did.

998
00:51:10,312 --> 00:51:12,690
- What's this?
- Shut the fuck up.

999
00:51:12,773 --> 00:51:15,442
- The fuck?
- Get your ass on the ground now.

1000
00:51:15,776 --> 00:51:17,778
Get on the ground!

1001
00:51:18,028 --> 00:51:19,988
On the ground?
What am I supposed to do with this?

1002
00:51:20,030 --> 00:51:21,240
Get on the ground.

1003
00:51:21,323 --> 00:51:23,158
What we do?

1004
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,202
Get down! Get on the ground, now!

1005
00:51:25,536 --> 00:51:27,746
Get your punk ass on the ground. Let's go.

1006
00:51:27,830 --> 00:51:28,873
Get the fuck down.

1007
00:51:28,914 --> 00:51:30,791
Hands behind your back.
Interlock your fingers.

1008
00:51:30,916 --> 00:51:33,085
- This is fucked up.
- Interlock 'em!

1009
00:51:33,168 --> 00:51:35,629
The fuck you got us
on the ground like this for, officer?

1010
00:51:35,713 --> 00:51:38,048
For our protection.
There's seven of you and four of us.

1011
00:51:38,299 --> 00:51:39,592
So sit tight and let us do our job.

1012
00:51:39,675 --> 00:51:41,594
Hey, officer, I'm sorry.
What is going on out here?

1013
00:51:41,677 --> 00:51:43,220
Sir, can you stay right there, please?

1014
00:51:43,262 --> 00:51:45,139
We're trying to check these bangers,
make sure they're clean.

1015
00:51:45,222 --> 00:51:47,391
All right, I'm sorry,
these are not bangers, okay?

1016
00:51:47,725 --> 00:51:49,602
These, um... These are artists.

1017
00:51:50,185 --> 00:51:51,854
- Excuse me. Artists?
- Yeah.

1018
00:51:51,896 --> 00:51:53,063
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

1019
00:51:53,147 --> 00:51:54,523
- What kind of artists?
- Rappers.

1020
00:51:54,565 --> 00:51:56,734
And they're working with me
in the studio right now.

1021
00:51:56,775 --> 00:51:59,612
Well, see, rap is not an art.
And I'm sorry, who are you?

1022
00:51:59,987 --> 00:52:01,071
I'm the manager.

1023
00:52:01,155 --> 00:52:03,657
Well, you're wasting your time,
Mr. Manager.

1024
00:52:03,741 --> 00:52:05,618
- You gotta be kidding me.
- You're wasting your time.

1025
00:52:05,701 --> 00:52:07,286
- Really?
- These clients of yours, these rappers...

1026
00:52:07,369 --> 00:52:09,246
- Yeah.
- They look like gang members.

1027
00:52:10,039 --> 00:52:13,334
You can't come down here and arrest people
just because of what they look like.

1028
00:52:13,417 --> 00:52:16,128
What, are you crazy?
But, that's police harassment.

1029
00:52:16,253 --> 00:52:17,588
- You said you're a manager, right?
- Yeah.

1030
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:20,216
- Not a fuckin' lawyer.
- Does that matter?

1031
00:52:20,424 --> 00:52:23,344
You cannot come down here
and harass these guys

1032
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:25,554
- because they're black! People have rights!
- Calm down.

1033
00:52:25,596 --> 00:52:27,139
Step back! Step back!

1034
00:52:27,223 --> 00:52:29,516
I'll step back, you let them up.
Get up, guys.

1035
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,268
Come on. Eric!

1036
00:52:31,310 --> 00:52:33,354
- You don't tell them to get up.
- Get up.

1037
00:52:33,437 --> 00:52:34,772
- I'm stepping back.
- We will decide that.

1038
00:52:34,813 --> 00:52:37,574
You have no idea the people I know.
I'm gonna call the Mayor's office.

1039
00:52:37,608 --> 00:52:39,026
Step back.

1040
00:52:53,791 --> 00:52:55,668
Now get up.

1041
00:52:58,295 --> 00:53:00,172
Get up, now!

1042
00:53:01,799 --> 00:53:03,133
Okay. Come on, guys.

1043
00:53:03,175 --> 00:53:04,635
And you keep your people in line,
you understand?

1044
00:53:04,677 --> 00:53:06,637
And the fuck out of Torrance.

1045
00:53:07,471 --> 00:53:08,931
- Good. Come on, guys.
- You got a problem?

1046
00:53:09,014 --> 00:53:10,015
It's my jersey.

1047
00:53:10,307 --> 00:53:12,142
You ain't tough now, huh?

1048
00:53:12,351 --> 00:53:13,978
Eric, come on. Let's go.

1049
00:53:14,103 --> 00:53:15,980
- You got a problem?
- Yella.

1050
00:53:18,649 --> 00:53:20,776
- I didn't hear you.
- Let's go.

1051
00:53:20,859 --> 00:53:23,112
- Yous a fuckin' sellout.
- Shut up.

1052
00:53:24,947 --> 00:53:27,825
- Everything's fine. Okay?
- Yeah.

1053
00:53:28,117 --> 00:53:30,286
- You got something to say?
- Cube.

1054
00:53:30,327 --> 00:53:31,871
You got something to say, boy?

1055
00:53:31,954 --> 00:53:34,290
Cube. Get inside. Let's get back to work.

1056
00:53:34,331 --> 00:53:36,959
You heard what your master said.
Get inside, boy.

1057
00:53:37,376 --> 00:53:39,003
You shut the fuck up!

1058
00:53:39,587 --> 00:53:41,630
Hey. Get the fuck back inside.

1059
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:44,508
Get inside, Cube.

1060
00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:48,095
We're gonna go back and work. Okay?

1061
00:53:48,178 --> 00:53:50,222
Leave us alone. You know, leave us alone.

1062
00:53:50,681 --> 00:53:52,016
Fuckin' rap music.

1063

Fuckin' disgraceful.

1064
00:53:57,521 --> 00:53:59,273
I got something for this beat.

1065
00:54:01,025 --> 00:54:02,860
Hey, yo, Yella, cut it.

1066
00:54:04,278 --> 00:54:05,946
What is it lookin' like, Dre? It's hard?

1067
00:54:06,071 --> 00:54:07,740
Yo.

1068
00:54:12,953 --> 00:54:13,954
- Hell yeah, Cube.
- Yeah.

1069
00:54:14,038 --> 00:54:16,874
This gonna start some shit,
but this what we need. Hell yeah!

Are you going
out there with them or not?

1098
00:55:40,249 --> 00:55:43,460
No. I had enough of that shit in the '70s.

1099
00:55:43,544 --> 00:55:46,797
But I'm gonna fly out there a bunch of times,
and I'm gonna check on them.

1100
00:55:46,881 --> 00:55:48,716
Can you just make sure
that everything goes smooth, please?

1101
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:49,800
Of course.

00:56:04,356 --> 00:56:05,649
Are you fucking nuts?

1110
00:56:05,691 --> 00:56:07,651
Jesus, Eric. Are you out of your mind?

- What?
- You can't take that on the bus.

1112
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:11,989
How am I supposed to protect myself

everything else good.

00:56:26,587 --> 00:56:29,423
A'ight, look... Otis, get the bags.
Put them on the van.

1120
00:56:29,506 --> 00:56:32,968
You feel better? We're not even riding
with them no more, Jerry.

1121
00:56:33,010 --> 00:56:35,554
- Unbelievable. Jesus Christ.
- No, no, no, do not put those on the...

Get off the phone.

00:59:20,511 --> 00:59:23,013
I still got the same ones
you gave me a long time ago.

1194

Hey, hey. Hold on, T. Somebody at the door.

Ain't no Felicia in here, nigga.

1201

Mind if I take a look?

1202
00:59:43,868 --> 00:59:45,619
Get the fuck outta my room, man.

1203
00:59:47,454 --> 00:59:49,540
This nigga just came
to my motherfuckin' door strapped, man.

1204
00:59:49,623 --> 00:59:51,041
Where are you going?

1205

I'll show that nigga strapped.

1206
00:59:52,668 --> 00:59:53,919
Hey, where Felicia at?

1207
00:59:54,003 --> 00:59:55,603
- Where Felicia?
- Where's your homegirl.

1208
00:59:55,629 --> 00:59:56,881
You Felicia?

1209
00:59:56,964 --> 00:59:58,507
Hey, Felicia. You Felicia?

1210
00:59:58,632 --> 01:00:00,301
Felicia? Her dude here.

1211
01:00:00,384 --> 01:00:03,971
All right.
So none of y'all are named Felicia now. Okay.

1212
01:00:04,054 --> 01:00:06,557
Yella! Hey, Yella!

1213
01:00:07,182 --> 01:00:08,601
Your name Felicia?

1214
01:00:09,059 --> 01:00:11,145

1215
01:00:12,187 --> 01:00:13,787
- Valerie. Your name Valerie.
- Whatever.

1216
01:00:14,064 --> 01:00:16,483
Felicia! Girl, your nigga's out there.

1217
01:00:16,650 --> 01:00:17,902
She's suckin' dick, though.

1218
01:00:17,985 --> 01:00:19,486
He got guns, girl. Come on!

1219
01:00:19,570 --> 01:00:20,821
The nigga is strapped.

1220
01:00:20,905 --> 01:00:22,823
I'll show this nigga right now.
Talkin' about gettin' strapped.

01:00:22,907 --> 01:00:24,783
Hey, Ren.

Let's ride, nigga.
Time to go to work.

1227
01:00:40,466 --> 01:00:42,676
Hey. Y'all looking for Felicia?

1228
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:44,553
She in there or what?

1229
01:00:45,804 --> 01:00:48,766
She kinda preoccupied
with some real nigga dick.

1230
01:00:48,933 --> 01:00:50,392
The fuck you say, little nigga?

1231
01:00:50,601 --> 01:00:53,520
I said, she got
a motherfuckin' dick in her mouth, nigga.

1232
01:00:53,604 --> 01:00:55,314
That ain't fun no more?

1233
01:00:55,397 --> 01:00:56,482
The fuck y'all going?

1234
01:00:56,565 --> 01:00:58,285
Nigga, she's trying to compensate.

1235
01:00:59,944 --> 01:01:01,320
Wow!

1236

Fat niggas was bullshit!

1237

Punk-ass niggas, man.

Nigga runnin' so fast, that shit was crazy.

Don't let that shit bother you.

1242
01:01:12,957 --> 01:01:14,375
- Tryin' to get me killed?
- Whatever.

1243
01:01:14,458 --> 01:01:16,669
Nigga, ain't tryin'
to take no bullet for no bitch,

1244
01:01:16,794 --> 01:01:18,212
I guarantee you that.

1245
01:01:18,379 --> 01:01:19,797

You're flying up
the <i>Billboard</i> 200 albums chart.

1255
01:01:56,333 --> 01:01:57,835
R&B and hip-hop charts too.

1256
01:01:57,877 --> 01:02:00,671
You have any idea
how many records we're selling?

1257
01:02:00,754 --> 01:02:03,841
Ruthless has arrived, Eric.
We're fucking huge.

1258
01:02:03,883 --> 01:02:07,344
That is dope, Jerry. That's dope.

15 on that.

1264
01:02:20,858 --> 01:02:22,443
Man, fuck, man!

01:02:22,651 --> 01:02:24,411
Hey. Come on, man. Put that shit up.

1266
01:02:26,030 --> 01:02:28,407
Excuse me. Gentlemen, I'm sorry.

1267
01:02:28,490 --> 01:02:30,534
I don't mean to be the bearer of bad news.

1268
01:02:30,659 --> 01:02:31,869
What you got?

1269
01:02:32,995 --> 01:02:34,205
Oh, shit.

1270
01:02:34,330 --> 01:02:35,539
What's that?

1271
01:02:36,498 --> 01:02:38,125
Motherfuckin' FBI.

1272
01:02:40,294 --> 01:02:42,004
What the fuck?
I'm supposed to not care about this?

1273
01:02:42,087 --> 01:02:44,632
Wait, the FBI? They comin' after us, too?

1274
01:02:44,715 --> 01:02:45,716
Kind of.

1275
01:02:45,799 --> 01:02:47,301
I mean, what the letter say, Jerry?

1276
01:02:47,384 --> 01:02:49,303
Uh, basically, uh...

1277
01:02:49,845 --> 01:02:52,056
"A song recorded by the rap group N.W.A

1278
01:02:52,097 --> 01:02:54,558
"on their album <i>Straight Out Of Compton</i>

1279
01:02:54,725 --> 01:02:57,061
"encourages violence
against law enforcement.

1280
01:02:57,144 --> 01:02:59,271
"Advocating violence and assault is wrong,

1281
01:02:59,438 --> 01:03:03,317
"and we in the law enforcement community
take exception to such action."

1282
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:04,568
- Fuck that.
- Fuck that.

1283
01:03:04,610 --> 01:03:07,321
Fuck the law enforcement community.
We got freedom of speech, man.

1284
01:03:07,488 --> 01:03:09,448
- What the fuck can they do to us?
- Right.

1285
01:03:09,490 --> 01:03:10,783
You wanna provoke 'em and find out?

1286
01:03:10,908 --> 01:03:12,451
Because this is a warning, Cube.

1287
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:15,704
And it's about <i>Fuck Tha Police,
</i>in particular, so...

1288
01:03:16,872 --> 01:03:20,251
I think maybe we should not
play that song right now.

1289
01:03:20,376 --> 01:03:23,045
Not play what? Fuck that, Jerry.
That's what the song is about.

1290
01:03:23,170 --> 01:03:24,838
Relax, relax.
We're not giving in to anything.

1291
01:03:24,922 --> 01:03:25,965
No. No.

1292
01:03:26,048 --> 01:03:28,300
I just say we retire it for now, okay?

1293
01:03:28,425 --> 01:03:30,302
It is a reasonably worded threat.

1294
01:03:31,387 --> 01:03:34,598
This isn't street bullshit.
This isn't the Crips and Bloods and crap.

1295
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:35,891
This is the federal government.

1296
01:03:35,933 --> 01:03:38,602
These guys can come after us
a million different ways.

1297
01:03:38,686 --> 01:03:40,771
I don't even want to think about it.
Why provoke them?

1298
01:03:40,813 --> 01:03:41,939
The fuck does that mean?

1299
01:03:42,022 --> 01:03:43,941
If it was the LAPD,
maybe I'd be a little worried,

1300
01:03:43,983 --> 01:03:45,609
but we can't let them censor us, Jerry.

1301
01:03:45,651 --> 01:03:47,653
- I'm not advocating for censorship, Cube.
- Wait. Wait.

1302
01:03:47,736 --> 01:03:51,782
Maybe none of us should be worried.
Maybe we should be happy.

1303
01:03:52,741 --> 01:03:54,301
- What you mean, E?
- Dunno about happy.

1304
01:03:54,368 --> 01:03:56,203
'Cause you see,
this right here is a gift.

1305
01:03:56,328 --> 01:03:57,621
It's the FBI, E. Whatchu talking about?

1306
01:03:57,705 --> 01:04:02,126
This is free publicity for N.W.A.

1307
01:04:02,710 --> 01:04:04,712
We take this to the press and we show them

1308
01:04:05,004 --> 01:04:08,591
what type of intimidation,
discrimination, and harassment

1309
01:04:08,632 --> 01:04:10,175
that we dealing with from our government.

1310
01:04:10,259 --> 01:04:11,802
- I like that shit.
- I'm with that.

1311
01:04:11,927 --> 01:04:14,127
- That's a different thing.
- My nigga, I feel you.

1312
01:04:14,179 --> 01:04:16,899
- If that's what you wanna do, then we can...
- That's what I wanna do.

1313
01:04:16,974 --> 01:04:19,935
That's what we wanna do, Jerry. That's it.

1314
01:04:21,145 --> 01:04:22,813
That's what we wanna do.

1315
01:04:22,855 --> 01:04:23,981
Okay.

1316
01:04:24,106 --> 01:04:26,150
- Yeah?
- You good?

1317
01:04:26,191 --> 01:04:27,484
I mean...

1318
01:04:27,568 --> 01:04:30,070
- Hate to be the bearer of bad news...
- Mmm-hmm.

1319
01:04:30,154 --> 01:04:32,239
- But 20!
- 20, man!

1320
01:04:32,323 --> 01:04:34,200
Wait a minute, that ain't 20.

1321
01:04:34,283 --> 01:04:36,660
- Hey, hey, hey. Shhh.
- What's up?

1322
01:04:36,744 --> 01:04:38,829
Let's not get thrown out
of another fuckin' hotel.

1323
01:04:38,913 --> 01:04:40,164
Goodnight, Jerry.

1324
01:04:40,497 --> 01:04:42,333
Compton's crap!

1325
01:04:42,708 --> 01:04:44,335

1327

1328
01:04:49,798 --> 01:04:51,258
This is not music!

1329
01:04:51,342 --> 01:04:54,678
Shit, the truth is,
they can do whatever they want with 'em.

1330
01:04:56,055 --> 01:04:57,348

you got all these problems.

You're gonna have to take care of 'em.
It's fine.

01:05:52,403 --> 01:05:54,071
I'll help you take care of 'em.

1353
01:05:54,196 --> 01:05:56,991
- Hey, Cube.
- Sorry to interrupt y'all lobster brunch.

1354
01:05:57,867 --> 01:06:00,411
But what's up, E? Where the contracts at,
man? You forgot about me?

1355
01:06:00,494 --> 01:06:02,014
Didn't I tell you to... You know what?

1356
01:06:02,413 --> 01:06:03,747
Jerry, you want to deal with this?

1357
01:06:03,789 --> 01:06:05,291
I'm not talking to Jerry,
I'm talking to you.

1358
01:06:05,374 --> 01:06:06,584
That's Jerry's job.

1359
01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:09,270
It's my department.
You're absolutely right to ask, Cube.

1360
01:06:09,295 --> 01:06:11,964
The contracts are being
finalized as we speak.

1361
01:06:12,506 --> 01:06:15,175
The thing is,
with these attorneys, they'll take forever.

1362
01:06:15,342 --> 01:06:18,762
Pouring over it, they'll bleed us dry.
But, they're gonna get done.

1363
01:06:18,804 --> 01:06:21,432
I wish I got paid by the hour the way they do.
You know?

1364
01:06:21,807 --> 01:06:23,392
Me, too.

1365
01:06:23,517 --> 01:06:27,813
I just want to know what's goin' on
since I did write a lot of lyrics on this record.

1366
01:06:29,315 --> 01:06:31,483
Everybody knows
how important you are, Cube.

1367
01:06:32,318 --> 01:06:33,694
They do?

1368
01:06:35,154 --> 01:06:36,655
That's what's goin' on.

1369
01:06:37,031 --> 01:06:38,991
We just need some time, that's all.

1370
01:06:42,536 --> 01:06:44,747
Everything probably all right.

1371
01:06:45,623 --> 01:06:47,124
I must be trippin'.

1372
01:06:53,297 --> 01:06:55,049
Shit tastes pretty good.

1373
01:06:56,091 --> 01:06:57,509
Someday, right?

1374
01:06:59,970 --> 01:07:01,388
Y'all enjoy your meal.

1375
01:07:01,472 --> 01:07:02,473
Okay.

1376
01:07:08,646 --> 01:07:11,815
I'm telling you, that guy wants
to be you very frickin' badly.

1377
01:07:11,857 --> 01:07:13,859
As if I ain't got enough fucking problems.

1378
01:07:13,943 --> 01:07:15,778
Excuse me. Can I get a refill?

1379
01:07:15,819 --> 01:07:17,821
At some point,
you just gotta trust somebody.

1380
01:07:18,989 --> 01:07:20,241
You know?

1381
01:07:21,659 --> 01:07:23,619
You gotta trust somebody.

1382
01:07:25,829 --> 01:07:27,749
Nah, I just think
you overreacting, man.

1383
01:07:27,998 --> 01:07:31,085
Eazy one of us, Cube.
What you thinkin' don't even make sense.

1384
01:07:31,168 --> 01:07:32,336
No, what don't make sense is

1385
01:07:32,419 --> 01:07:36,590
Eazy and Jerry eating steak and lobster
and we eating Fatburger.

1386
01:07:36,674 --> 01:07:37,925
Shit don't make no sense.

1387
01:07:38,008 --> 01:07:42,096
Look, I hear you,
but I think we need to ride this wave.

1388
01:07:42,513 --> 01:07:43,973
For real.

1389
01:07:44,014 --> 01:07:46,214
Don't be jumping to conclusions
until you know for sure.

1390
01:07:46,267 --> 01:07:48,477
You know?

1391
01:07:54,275 --> 01:07:56,110
It's my moms, man.

1392
01:08:15,170 --> 01:08:16,672
Yo, Dre,

1393
01:08:17,047 --> 01:08:18,424
what's going on?

1394
01:08:21,886 --> 01:08:23,804
Moms just called, man.

1395
01:08:27,683 --> 01:08:29,143
It's Tyree.

1396
01:08:30,185 --> 01:08:31,645
He's dead.

1397
01:08:32,229 --> 01:08:33,898
What? No.

1398
01:08:35,232 --> 01:08:38,319
He got into a fight,
some motherfucker broke his neck.

1399
01:08:41,697 --> 01:08:43,741
It's my little brother, man.

1400
01:08:47,912 --> 01:08:49,705
It's my little baby bro.

1401
01:09:08,974 --> 01:09:10,935
I never told y'all this.

1402
01:09:11,852 --> 01:09:14,605
But when I was 12, my sister got killed.

1403
01:09:15,773 --> 01:09:18,984
Her own husband killed her,
then killed himself.

1404
01:09:30,287 --> 01:09:32,665
This dope gang took my cousin too.

1405
01:09:36,794 --> 01:09:38,879
Shot him in the trunk of a car.

1406
01:09:41,632 --> 01:09:43,300
Fucking Compton, man.

1407
01:09:43,801 --> 01:09:45,636
Come on, man, like...

1408
01:09:47,012 --> 01:09:48,514
It's my fault, man.

1409
01:09:48,973 --> 01:09:50,474
Don't talk like that.

1410
01:09:50,516 --> 01:09:52,434
This never would've happened
if I had him out here, man.

1411
01:09:52,476 --> 01:09:53,561
Come on, Dre.

1412
01:09:53,644 --> 01:09:55,187
It's my fuckin' fault.

1413
01:09:55,312 --> 01:09:57,147
It could've happened in another way.

1414
01:09:58,524 --> 01:10:00,651
- You can't blame yourself for that, Dre.
- No.

1415
01:10:01,026 --> 01:10:03,696
Tyree gonna always be with you.
No matter what.

1416
01:10:04,238 --> 01:10:06,574
- That's right.
- Yeah, for real, man.

1417
01:10:06,782 --> 01:10:08,659
And we always gonna be with you.

1418
01:10:08,826 --> 01:10:10,327
Hell yeah.

1419
01:10:10,369 --> 01:10:11,829
We always gonna be brothers.

1420
01:10:11,954 --> 01:10:14,373
Fuck.

1421
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:18,127
We here, a'ight.

1422
01:10:18,252 --> 01:10:19,670
I'm sorry, man.

1423
01:10:19,712 --> 01:10:21,005
You good, Dre.

1424
01:10:25,885 --> 01:10:28,178
<i>This is not on you, Andre.</i>

1425
01:10:29,847 --> 01:10:33,183
If I had just brought him on tour with me.
Like he wanted.

1426
01:10:33,225 --> 01:10:35,185
Stop this nonsense now. Stop it.

1427
01:10:36,353 --> 01:10:38,606
Your brother looked up to you,

1428
01:10:38,689 --> 01:10:41,400
and you took great care of him,
we both did.

1429
01:10:42,860 --> 01:10:46,238
It's time to let someone else
take care of him now.

1430
01:10:59,335 --> 01:11:01,003
I'm proud of you.

1431
01:11:26,403 --> 01:11:30,449
No person shall disturb the peace
by participating or abetting

1432
01:11:30,532 --> 01:11:33,994
in any rude, indecent, drunken,

1433
01:11:34,078 --> 01:11:36,038
riotous or violent conduct.

1434
01:11:36,372 --> 01:11:38,666
Or the use of any vulgar, obscene

1435
01:11:38,749 --> 01:11:40,960
or abusive language in a public place.

1436
01:11:41,418 --> 01:11:43,963
Note also, the performance of the song

1437
01:11:44,046 --> 01:11:48,008
"F the Police", will not be permitted.

1438
01:11:48,592 --> 01:11:51,345
Refusal to abide
by all the Detroit City Ordinances

1439
01:11:51,971 --> 01:11:54,974
will result in immediate
arrest and forfeiture.

1440
01:11:56,767 --> 01:11:59,353
Are we finished here? We got a show to do.

1441
01:12:03,816 --> 01:12:05,442
Just watch yourself.

1442
01:12:08,654 --> 01:12:10,281
Eat a dick.

1443
01:12:10,948 --> 01:12:12,825
It's "Fuck tha Police."

1444
01:12:13,075 --> 01:12:14,493
<i>Straight outta Compton</i>

1447

1449
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:25,129
<i>So what about the bitch
who got shot? Fuck her!</i>

1450
01:12:25,212 --> 01:12:27,548
<i>You think I give a damn
about a bitch? I ain't a sucker!</i>

1451
01:12:27,631 --> 01:12:30,426
<i>This is an autobiography of the E</i>

1452
01:12:30,467 --> 01:12:31,844
<i>And if you ever fuck with me</i>

1453
01:12:31,927 --> 01:12:33,137
<i>You'll get taken</i>

1454
01:12:33,178 --> 01:12:35,097
<i>by a stupid dope brother who will smother</i>

1455
01:12:35,222 --> 01:12:38,100
<i>Word to the motherfucker
Straight outta Compton</i>

1456
01:12:41,937 --> 01:12:44,523
Eazy! Eazy!

1457
01:12:53,365 --> 01:12:55,784
<i>Damn, that shit was dope!</i>

1458
01:13:10,049 --> 01:13:11,467
What's up?

1459
01:13:11,592 --> 01:13:13,010
Let's do this shit.

1460
01:13:13,093 --> 01:13:14,595
- What's up?
- Let's do this shit.

1461
01:13:15,596 --> 01:13:17,348
- Wassup? Let's go.
- What's up?

1462
01:13:21,477 --> 01:13:23,687
<i>Hey, hold up, hold up.</i>

1463
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:26,273
<i>Y'all know
what the motherfuckin' police</i>

1464
01:13:26,357 --> 01:13:27,650
<i>tried to tell us backstage?</i>

1465
01:13:27,816 --> 01:13:29,151
What?

1466
01:13:29,193 --> 01:13:32,905
<i>They tried to tell us
what the fuck we can't play.</i>

1467
01:13:35,658 --> 01:13:37,743
<i>Motherfuckers tried to tell us</i>

1468
01:13:38,536 --> 01:13:40,704
<i>what the fuck we can't say.</i>

1469

<i>We say what the fuck we wanna say!</i>

1472
01:13:54,927 --> 01:13:56,554
<i>So, everybody,</i>

01:13:56,720 --> 01:13:59,056
<i>put the middle fingers high in the sky.</i>

1474
01:14:01,767 --> 01:14:04,395
<i>And to the punk-ass cop backstage...</i>

1475
01:14:19,076 --> 01:14:20,244
<i>Yo, Dre.</i>

1476
01:14:20,369 --> 01:14:22,746
<i>- What up?
- I got something to say.</i>

1477
01:14:25,249 --> 01:14:26,292
<i>Fuck the police</i>

1478
01:14:26,375 --> 01:14:28,127
<i>Comin' straight from the underground</i>

1479

<i>A young nigga got it bad 'cause I'm brown</i>

1480
01:14:30,296 --> 01:14:32,256
<i>And not the other color so police think</i>

1481
01:14:32,506 --> 01:14:35,009
<i>they have the authority to kill a minority</i>

1482
01:14:35,092 --> 01:14:37,052
<i>Fuck that shit 'cause I ain't the one</i>

1483
01:14:37,261 --> 01:14:39,597
<i>For a punk motherfucker

1484
01:14:39,638 --> 01:14:42,099
<i>to be beaten on and thrown in jail</i>

1485
01:14:42,224 --> 01:14:44,727
<i>We can go toe to toe in
the middle of a cell</i>

1486
01:14:44,768 --> 01:14:47,271
<i>Fucking with me 'cause I'm a teenager</i>

1487
01:14:47,354 --> 01:14:49,565
<i>With a little bit of gold and a pager</i>

1488
01:14:49,607 --> 01:14:52,067
<i>Searching my car looking for the product</i>

1489
01:14:52,109 --> 01:14:54,570
<i>Thinking every nigga is selling narcotics</i>

1490

<i>Beat a police out of shape</i>

1493
01:15:01,619 --> 01:15:02,786
<i>Then when I'm finished</i>

1494
01:15:02,828 --> 01:15:03,996
<i>Bring the yellow tape</i>

1495
01:15:04,246 --> 01:15:06,624
<i>To tape off the scene of the slaughter</i>

1496
01:15:06,665 --> 01:15:09,376
<i>Still getting swoll off bread and water</i>

1497
01:15:09,460 --> 01:15:11,295
<i>I don't know if they fags or what</i>

1498
01:15:11,503 --> 01:15:13,631
<i>Search a nigga down and grabbing his nuts</i>

1499
01:15:13,714 --> 01:15:16,592
<i>And on the other hand,
without a gun they can't get none</i>

1500
01:15:16,634 --> 01:15:18,969
<i>But don't let it be a black and a white one</i>

1501
01:15:19,053 --> 01:15:21,305
<i>'Cause they'll slam ya

<i>Just 'cause I'm from the CPT</i>

1506
01:15:31,023 --> 01:15:33,651
<i>Punk police are afraid of me, huh</i>

1507
01:15:33,692 --> 01:15:35,527
<i>A young nigga on the warpath</i>

1508
01:15:35,611 --> 01:15:38,447
<i>And when I'm finished,
it's gonna be a bloodbath</i>

1509
01:15:38,489 --> 01:15:40,908
<i>Of cops, dyin' in LA</i>

Huh? Fuck!

Come on, nigga.

Hell no! They shootin'! Let's go!

1519
01:16:01,345 --> 01:16:03,097
Go, go! All units, move in.

Go, go, go, go, go! Come on, man!

1523

Come on, hurry up! Hurry up!

1524
01:16:18,153 --> 01:16:19,753

Shit, shit, shit, shit!

1529
01:16:27,621 --> 01:16:28,873
Get off me!

1530
01:16:28,914 --> 01:16:30,624
Get the fuck off me!

Man, get off me, man!

Away from the ledge.

1533
01:16:39,758 --> 01:16:41,969
Backup!
We need backup in the loading area!

1534

Fuck y'all.

1538
01:16:53,522 --> 01:16:56,567
This is completely fucking illegal!
You realize that?

1539
01:16:57,401 --> 01:16:59,737
Let us go! Let me go! Come on, man.

1540
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:02,197
- Fuck you! Fuck you!

01:17:02,281 --> 01:17:03,616
Fuck you! Fuck you!

Get in there!
You gotta get in there.

1543
01:17:06,118 --> 01:17:08,537
Fuck tha police! Fuck tha police!

1544

Fuck tha police! Fuck tha police!

1545
01:17:10,956 --> 01:17:14,752
Fuck your mama,
fuck your daddy, fuck your grandma!

1546
01:17:16,754 --> 01:17:18,255
Fucking...

1547

These motherfuckers.

1548
01:17:25,221 --> 01:17:27,264
Fuck y'all!

1549
01:17:43,155 --> 01:17:44,990
How do you explain
inciting a riot in Detroit?

1550
01:17:45,157 --> 01:17:46,450
What do you have to say about that?

1551
01:17:46,575 --> 01:17:49,286
I have to say that we
didn't incite that shit.

1552
01:17:49,787 --> 01:17:53,040
Right. Like, y'all just got a snapshot
of how Americans really feel.

1553
01:17:53,123 --> 01:17:55,334
We gave the people a voice.

1554
01:17:55,876 --> 01:17:57,962
We gave the people truth.

1555
01:17:58,462 --> 01:18:02,800
Yeah, but your songs, they glamorize
the lifestyle of gangs, guns, drugs.

1556
01:18:02,967 --> 01:18:05,177
Our art is a reflection of our reality.

1557
01:18:05,928 --> 01:18:07,638
What you see
when you go outside your door?

1558
01:18:08,055 --> 01:18:09,098
I know what I see.

1559
01:18:09,181 --> 01:18:10,266
And it ain't glamorous.

1560
01:18:10,432 --> 01:18:13,310
We get AKs from Russia
and cocaine from Columbia.

1561
01:18:13,852 --> 01:18:16,230
And ain't none of us got a passport, so...

1562
01:18:17,523 --> 01:18:19,024
...might wanna check the source.

1563
01:18:19,483 --> 01:18:20,484
Next question.

1564
01:18:20,526 --> 01:18:22,886
Will you be more careful
about what you say, how you say it?

1565
01:18:22,987 --> 01:18:24,572
- No!
- Probably not. Nah.

1566
01:18:25,197 --> 01:18:27,783
Freedom of speech
includes rap music, right?

1567
01:18:27,825 --> 01:18:31,495
Well, we exercising our first amendment
as far as I'm concerned.

1568
01:18:31,579 --> 01:18:33,497
And the government wrote that.

1569
01:18:34,456 --> 01:18:36,417
So, Cube, what's a guy from Compton

1570
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:38,752
do when he starts making
real money like this?

1571
01:18:45,092 --> 01:18:46,343
Cube?

1572
01:18:47,344 --> 01:18:49,346
Buy Raider gear.

1573
01:18:49,763 --> 01:18:51,807
And curl activator.

1574
01:18:53,017 --> 01:18:54,393
Next question.

1575
01:19:10,075 --> 01:19:11,535
Good to see you, Cube.

1576
01:19:11,911 --> 01:19:13,704
I can barely see you, Jerry.

1577
01:19:14,288 --> 01:19:16,081
What's with all the <i>Godfather</i> shit?

1578
01:19:18,042 --> 01:19:19,293
Okay.

1579
01:19:19,710 --> 01:19:22,463
I know that you've been very eager to sign

1580
01:19:22,546 --> 01:19:25,549
a contract with Eric's company,
Ruthless Records.

1581
01:19:25,591 --> 01:19:27,551
Eric's company? Ain't it your company, too?

1582
01:19:27,801 --> 01:19:31,472
That's incorrect.
It's not my company. I work for you.

1583
01:19:31,597 --> 01:19:33,015
- You work for me?
- Uh-huh.

1584
01:19:33,224 --> 01:19:34,975
I've made that clear from the beginning.

1585
01:19:35,226 --> 01:19:37,061
All right, cool.
So, I could take this to a lawyer

1586
01:19:37,144 --> 01:19:38,187
or somebody, right?

1587
01:19:38,229 --> 01:19:40,564
Cube, those guys are paid to make trouble.

1588
01:19:40,731 --> 01:19:43,400
They're gonna create problems
where no problems exist.

1589
01:19:43,609 --> 01:19:46,320
Jerry, you know I don't know
what none of this legal shit mean.

1590
01:19:46,820 --> 01:19:48,280
All right? None of us do.

1591
01:19:48,656 --> 01:19:50,491
So we're gonna need a lawyer
before we sign anything.

1592
01:19:50,574 --> 01:19:52,368
Everybody else has already signed.

1593
01:19:54,245 --> 01:19:56,038
I thought you knew this.

1594
01:19:56,372 --> 01:19:57,998
You're the only one who hasn't.

1595
01:20:03,587 --> 01:20:05,339
There's also this.

1596
01:20:06,215 --> 01:20:07,758
$75,000.

1597
01:20:12,137 --> 01:20:13,264
Shit!

1598
01:20:13,389 --> 01:20:14,723
Sign the contract

1599
01:20:14,807 --> 01:20:16,559
and all this money is yours.

1600
01:20:16,725 --> 01:20:19,186
That's my money anyway, Jerry.
I earned that money.

1601
01:20:19,603 --> 01:20:21,772
- And I wrote a lot of hit songs.
- Mmm-hmm.

1602
01:20:21,897 --> 01:20:23,774
We've been performing
on this tour for months.

1603
01:20:23,941 --> 01:20:25,776
Sellin' out shows, sellin' records.

1604
01:20:26,235 --> 01:20:28,070
I know there's plenty of money.

1605
01:20:28,279 --> 01:20:30,447
Really? Jesus Christ.

1606
01:20:31,198 --> 01:20:32,283
Give me my money, Jerry.

1607
01:20:32,324 --> 01:20:33,826
How the hell do you think this works?

1608
01:20:34,535 --> 01:20:37,621
How the hell do you think
all of this gets paid for?

1609
01:20:38,289 --> 01:20:40,791
The hotel rooms, the tour buses,

1610
01:20:41,041 --> 01:20:44,169
security, the parties, all this shit.

1611
01:20:44,253 --> 01:20:46,463
How do you think it gets paid for?
You think it's free?

1612
01:20:46,505 --> 01:20:48,132
Why are you doing this now?

1613
01:20:48,465 --> 01:20:51,302
If we were so good, why didn't you give us
contracts in the beginning?

1614
01:20:51,468 --> 01:20:53,470
Because nothing is a sure thing, Cube.

1615
01:20:54,805 --> 01:20:57,808
Even a great talent can crash and burn.

1616
01:21:00,769 --> 01:21:03,063
Too much ego, too much excess,

1617
01:21:03,606 --> 01:21:05,149
too many expectations.

1618
01:21:07,443 --> 01:21:10,446
It tends to ruin things.
You ought to keep that in mind.

1619
01:21:19,121 --> 01:21:20,998
This is Eric's company, right?

1620
01:21:25,294 --> 01:21:26,545
Bye, Jerry.

1621
01:21:27,087 --> 01:21:28,589
I'm out.

1622
01:21:54,323 --> 01:21:55,783
What up, big Suge?

1623
01:21:56,367 --> 01:21:57,451
Here you go.

1624
01:21:57,535 --> 01:21:58,702
Thank you, sir.

1625
01:21:59,870 --> 01:22:01,997
Hey, what up with D.O.C. and Suge?

1626
01:22:02,498 --> 01:22:05,584
I guess that dude
is gonna be managing him now.

1627
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:08,379
One day
you Bobby Brown's bodyguard,

1628
01:22:08,462 --> 01:22:10,339
and the next day, you reppin' talent.

1629
01:22:10,673 --> 01:22:11,924
Come on, man.

1630
01:22:12,049 --> 01:22:13,849
I guess everybody
wanna get into the act, huh?

1631
01:22:13,884 --> 01:22:15,052
I guess so.

1632
01:22:15,177 --> 01:22:16,554
All right, man.

1633
01:22:20,599 --> 01:22:22,268
I know, right?

1634
01:22:22,893 --> 01:22:25,271
- How you doin'? You good?
- Here you go.

1635
01:22:25,354 --> 01:22:27,356
I'm helping you out all I can.
You all right?

1636
01:22:27,815 --> 01:22:29,108
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I'm good.

1637
01:22:29,191 --> 01:22:31,277
- What's going on?
- Just happy to be home.

1638
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:32,653
You hungry?

1639
01:22:33,153 --> 01:22:34,238
Yeah?

1640
01:22:34,321 --> 01:22:35,906
I'll be there in a minute. All right?

1641
01:22:36,282 --> 01:22:37,533
Thanks, man.

1642
01:22:39,118 --> 01:22:40,578
- Thanks for everything, bruh.
- You bet!

1643
01:22:40,661 --> 01:22:42,413
So, Cube.

1644
01:22:42,913 --> 01:22:44,248
We gonna keep
this momentum going or what?

1645
01:22:44,331 --> 01:22:45,958
Nah, man. Not like this.

1646
01:22:46,917 --> 01:22:49,587
I'd rather be broke than to get fucked.

1647
01:22:49,628 --> 01:22:51,505
I told you not to sign that shit, Dre.

1648
01:22:51,589 --> 01:22:54,174
Nigga, I got bills to pay.
And you know that.

1649
01:22:54,675 --> 01:22:57,678
And I gotta put some money
in my momma's hand after Tyree passed, man.

1650
01:22:58,053 --> 01:22:59,597
- I feel you.
- Right.

1651
01:22:59,847 --> 01:23:01,599
We gotta do what we gotta do.

1652
01:23:02,474 --> 01:23:04,476
They're gonna take care of you.
You their bread and butter.

1653
01:23:04,602 --> 01:23:06,312
Cube, we Ruthless.

1654
01:23:06,770 --> 01:23:09,773
We N.W.A. They Ruthless.

1655
01:23:13,736 --> 01:23:15,613
Cube, you comin'?

1656
01:23:17,197 --> 01:23:18,908
I'm about to get out of here.

1657
01:23:20,242 --> 01:23:21,702
Take care of yourself, Dre.

1658
01:23:21,785 --> 01:23:22,953
Peace.

1659
01:23:34,965 --> 01:23:37,468
- Mom.
- I missed you.

1660
01:23:41,222 --> 01:23:42,806
- How you doing?
- I'm good.

1661
01:23:42,848 --> 01:23:44,183
- Good.
- Come on. Let's get home.

1662
01:23:44,266 --> 01:23:45,643
All right.

1663
01:23:46,393 --> 01:23:47,478
So you're leaving the group?

1664
01:23:47,519 --> 01:23:49,772
Yeah, I'm through with the bullshit.

1665
01:23:49,813 --> 01:23:53,192
Eazy put everything on Jerry,
Jerry put everything on Eazy.

1666
01:23:54,026 --> 01:23:55,986
It's a two-man show up there.
There ain't no fuckin' group.

1667
01:23:56,028 --> 01:23:59,406
I get that,
but I just want you to understand

1668
01:23:59,615 --> 01:24:02,576
that you are walking away
from a winning situation.

1669
01:24:03,494 --> 01:24:06,054
Now, how do you feel about this, Kim?
Is he making a big mistake?

1670
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:07,164
- A mistake?
- Yes.

1671
01:24:07,248 --> 01:24:08,624
I don't think so, okay.

1672
01:24:08,666 --> 01:24:11,168
After hearing all the stuff
that he went through, I would've left too.

1673
01:24:11,418 --> 01:24:14,171
Look, I want you to express yourself, Cube.

1674
01:24:14,255 --> 01:24:16,590
And I am your biggest fan.
I believe in you.

1675
01:24:16,674 --> 01:24:18,759
But I just want you to understand,

1676
01:24:18,842 --> 01:24:20,803
there's not a lot of
money in this solo play.

1677
01:24:21,220 --> 01:24:22,346
Okay?

1678
01:24:22,596 --> 01:24:24,181
But if the first record hits,

1679
01:24:24,765 --> 01:24:26,485
I will make it up to you on the second one.

1680
01:24:35,025 --> 01:24:36,735
Be ready, Bryan.

1681
01:24:36,944 --> 01:24:38,696
These records is comin' in fast.

1682
01:24:38,862 --> 01:24:41,156
<i>I heard payback's a motherfucking nigga</i>

1683
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:44,577
<i>That's why I'm sick
of getting treated like a goddamn stepchild</i>

1684
01:24:44,660 --> 01:24:45,995
<i>Fuck a punk 'cause I ain't him</i>

1685
01:24:46,036 --> 01:24:48,247
<i>You gotta deal with the nine-double-M</i>

1686
01:24:48,330 --> 01:24:49,999
<i>The damn scum that you all hate</i>

1687
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:52,626
<i>just think if niggas decide to retaliate</i>

1688
01:24:52,710 --> 01:24:54,295
<i>They try to keep me from running up</i>

1689
01:24:54,378 --> 01:24:57,131
<i>I never tell you to get down,
it's all about coming up</i>

1690
01:24:57,214 --> 01:24:59,133
<i>So what they do, go and ban the AK?</i>

1691
01:24:59,216 --> 01:25:01,552
<i>My shit wasn't registered any fucking way</i>

1692
01:25:01,635 --> 01:25:03,721
<i>So you better duck away, run and hide out</i>

1693
01:25:03,804 --> 01:25:06,015
<i>When I'm rolling real
slow and the lights out</i>

1694
01:25:06,056 --> 01:25:08,225
<i>'Cause I'm about to fuck up the program</i>

1695
01:25:08,267 --> 01:25:10,477
<i>Shooting out the window
of a drop-top Brougham</i>

1696
01:25:10,561 --> 01:25:12,563
<i>When I'm shooting let's see who drop</i>

1697
01:25:12,646 --> 01:25:14,899
<i>The police, the media,
suckers that went pop</i>

1698
01:25:14,982 --> 01:25:17,067
<i>And motherfuckers that say they too black</i>

1699
01:25:17,109 --> 01:25:19,361
<i>Put 'em overseas
they'll be begging to come back</i>

1700
01:25:19,403 --> 01:25:21,447
<i>They say he promote gangs and drugs</i>

1701
01:26:28,556 --> 01:26:31,684
You know Cube's record
is in the Top 20 <i>Billboard,</i> right now?

1702
01:26:32,101 --> 01:26:35,312
Our shit never been up there.
He blowin' the fuck up, Jerry.

1703
01:26:35,396 --> 01:26:36,605
It's gonna be fine, Eric.

1704
01:26:36,689 --> 01:26:38,983
It's not just N.W.A anymore,

1705
01:26:39,233 --> 01:26:40,776
it's our whole Ruthless roster.

1706
01:26:40,859 --> 01:26:44,363
We got D.O.C.,
we got Michel'le, we got Above the Law.

1707
01:26:44,655 --> 01:26:46,824
We're moving up to the next level.

1708
01:26:47,283 --> 01:26:48,883
You know what? Sit down for two seconds.

1709
01:26:48,951 --> 01:26:50,411
Look, we need to keep Dre happy.

1710
01:26:50,494 --> 01:26:51,912
Yeah.

1711
01:26:52,663 --> 01:26:53,747
Look at him.

1712
01:26:53,831 --> 01:26:55,751
You think he needs
any more motivation than that?

1713
01:26:55,791 --> 01:26:56,834
I mean, I get it, Jerry.

1714
01:26:56,917 --> 01:26:59,128
He drownin' in pussy and shit,
but that don't mean that he...

1715
01:26:59,169 --> 01:27:02,172
Now, you worry too much. Stop, okay?

1716
01:27:02,298 --> 01:27:03,632
Yeah, ar'ight.

1717
01:27:03,674 --> 01:27:05,175
Here, sign some checks.

1718
01:27:06,051 --> 01:27:07,595
- Right now, Jerry?
- Yes, right now.

1719
01:27:07,678 --> 01:27:09,054
- You're gonna be out of your mind later.
- Come on.

1720
01:27:09,179 --> 01:27:10,347
Do it now.

1721
01:27:10,431 --> 01:27:12,683
The fact is,
Ren is as good a writer as Cube.

1722
01:27:12,766 --> 01:27:14,101
Maybe even better.

1723
01:27:14,310 --> 01:27:15,519
We got everything covered.

1724
01:27:15,603 --> 01:27:17,855
Just the last one. Okay?

1725
01:27:19,940 --> 01:27:21,942
- We finished here, Jerry?
- We're finished.

1726
01:27:22,443 --> 01:27:25,487
Good. 'Cause I'm about to go fuck.

1727
01:27:27,364 --> 01:27:28,991
- Ar'ight.
- Yeah.

1728
01:28:08,656 --> 01:28:10,407
Now I'm only telling you what you told me.

1729
01:28:10,574 --> 01:28:12,284
If <i>AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted</i> blew up,

1730
01:28:12,368 --> 01:28:14,245
you'd pay me the advance for the follow-up.

1731
01:28:14,411 --> 01:28:15,746
Now is that not what the fuck you said?

1732
01:28:15,788 --> 01:28:17,206
That is what I said.

1733
01:28:17,248 --> 01:28:19,166
But it is more complicated than that, Cube.

1734
01:28:19,250 --> 01:28:20,251
Right, there are metrics...

1735
01:28:20,292 --> 01:28:21,335
Come on, Bryan!

1736
01:28:21,418 --> 01:28:23,963
I got a baby on the way
and a house I just paid for

1737
01:28:24,046 --> 01:28:25,798
off the strength of what you told me.

1738
01:28:25,965 --> 01:28:27,424
I mean, you gave me your word!

1739
01:28:27,466 --> 01:28:28,926
Cube, would you just calm down?

1740
01:28:29,009 --> 01:28:30,052
Calm down?

1741
01:28:30,094 --> 01:28:31,595
I am just trying to give you what you want.

1742
01:28:31,637 --> 01:28:33,305
You not. I been did the work...

1743
01:28:33,430 --> 01:28:36,225
I gave you the product.
Give me my money, Bryan!

1744
01:28:37,142 --> 01:28:39,937
When a man does the job,
he's supposed to get paid,

1745
01:28:39,979 --> 01:28:43,190
and you making it seem like I'm beggin'
for some shit that's technically mine.

1746
01:28:43,274 --> 01:28:45,859
Of course you are not begging.

1747
01:28:45,943 --> 01:28:49,363
And I am not trying to be difficult, man.
I promise you.

1748
01:28:52,157 --> 01:28:53,993
But you can't help me, right?

1749
01:28:55,286 --> 01:28:57,454
That's what you telling me?

1750
01:28:58,831 --> 01:29:00,457
My hands are tied, man.

1751
01:29:29,737 --> 01:29:30,738
Hey!

1752
01:29:32,197 --> 01:29:34,241
Shoulda kept your word, Bryan.

1753
01:29:35,701 --> 01:29:37,369
Jesus Christ, man!

1754
01:29:37,786 --> 01:29:39,955
What the fuck are you doing, Cube?

1755
01:29:40,122 --> 01:29:41,123
Goddamn!

1756
01:29:42,458 --> 01:29:45,085
I will get you your money, man.
Just... God damn it!

1757
01:29:45,169 --> 01:29:47,046
You think I give a fuck
about these fucking records?

1758
01:29:47,129 --> 01:29:49,506
I put up these fuckin' records!
This my shit!

1759
01:29:49,673 --> 01:29:52,259
I know that, Cube!
I will get you your money!

1760
01:29:52,343 --> 01:29:54,011
God damn it! I'm sorry.

1761
01:29:54,094 --> 01:29:55,346
Now I'm gonna fuck up your shit.

1762
01:29:55,387 --> 01:29:56,513
Look, do not...

1763
01:29:58,182 --> 01:29:59,391
God damn it!

1764
01:30:03,020 --> 01:30:04,772
Just, fine.

1765
01:30:06,482 --> 01:30:08,609
Take it out what you owe me.

1766
01:30:08,859 --> 01:30:10,694
Just...

1767
01:30:20,663 --> 01:30:22,081
<i>Prisoner like a hostage</i>

1768
01:30:22,248 --> 01:30:24,917
<i>Yo, you shoulda covered
your muthafucking head like an ostrich</i>

1769
01:30:25,125 --> 01:30:26,961
<i>Deep in the dirt 'cause you's a sucker</i>

1770
01:30:27,127 --> 01:30:29,463
<i>And your ass up high
so I can kick the muthafucker</i>

1771
01:30:29,630 --> 01:30:31,465
<i>Don't try to hang your best abroad</i>

1772
01:30:31,632 --> 01:30:34,192
<i>'Cause my foot will be so
far up your ass, you'll get hemorrhoids</i>

1773
01:30:34,301 --> 01:30:35,761
<i>Before you try to fuck wit Ren</i>

1774
01:30:36,178 --> 01:30:38,097
See that shit right there?
That's what I'm talking about.

1775
01:30:38,264 --> 01:30:40,015
Fuck that nigga Cube, man.
That nigga ain't shit.

1776
01:30:40,182 --> 01:30:42,851
How you figure, man?
His record the hottest shit out right now, E.

1777
01:30:43,018 --> 01:30:45,312
Yeah, man, for real. Cube killed that shit.

1778
01:30:45,479 --> 01:30:47,856
So we supposed to
just sit there and not say nothin',

1779
01:30:47,898 --> 01:30:49,233
and look like bitches and just take it?

1780
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:50,901
Take what?

1781
01:30:51,068 --> 01:30:54,488
I don't know what the fuck you talkin' about.
I like that shit.

1782
01:30:56,240 --> 01:30:57,283
Clown-ass.

1783
01:30:57,366 --> 01:30:59,076
Why you drunk all the goddamn time?

1784
01:30:59,159 --> 01:31:01,412
You need to get your shit together.
You's a motherfucking' artist,

1785
01:31:01,453 --> 01:31:02,872
if you ain't noticed.

1786
01:31:03,789 --> 01:31:06,125
How about you get
your shit together, little nigga.

1787
01:31:06,250 --> 01:31:07,251
Come on.

1788
01:31:07,376 --> 01:31:09,420
How about you get
your country-ass homeboy.

1789
01:31:09,587 --> 01:31:12,506
<i>'Cause the vocals were local in nightclubs

<i>They got the nerve to cuss
Only reason niggaz pick up your record</i>

1791
01:31:15,634 --> 01:31:17,386

1792
01:31:29,523 --> 01:31:30,608
Hello.

1793
01:31:30,649 --> 01:31:32,735
<i>Yo, Dre. D.O.C. was in an accident.</i>

1794
01:31:32,902 --> 01:31:35,321
What? An accident?

1795
01:31:44,413 --> 01:31:45,789
D.O.C. shouldn't even be alive.

1796
01:31:45,956 --> 01:31:47,833
Got thrown out a car, hit a tree.

1797
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,376
Is he paralyzed?

1798
01:31:49,543 --> 01:31:52,671
<i>No. But his throat got crushed.</i>

1799
01:31:52,838 --> 01:31:54,965
He could lose his career over this.

1800
01:31:57,134 --> 01:31:59,094
Where your people? Where Eazy and Jerry?

1801
01:31:59,261 --> 01:32:01,513
How the fuck should I know?

1802
01:32:01,680 --> 01:32:02,932
Come here.

1803
01:32:05,100 --> 01:32:07,394
Whatchu know about Jerry?
Whatchu think about him?

1804
01:32:07,561 --> 01:32:10,147
He a'ight. I guess.

1805
01:32:10,314 --> 01:32:13,025
What about your paperwork?
You cool with that?

1806
01:32:15,277 --> 01:32:16,278
I think.

1807
01:32:16,445 --> 01:32:17,488
You think?

1808
01:32:17,529 --> 01:32:19,531
Look, I just focus on the music, Suge.

1809
01:32:20,115 --> 01:32:21,659
That's it.

1810
01:32:22,159 --> 01:32:24,703
You see that motherfucker in there?

1811
01:32:26,330 --> 01:32:28,624
Gotta make sure it don't
happen to you, man.

1812
01:32:31,377 --> 01:32:32,878
Hey, uh...

1813
01:32:34,380 --> 01:32:37,883
Maybe some of your people
can look into my paperwork, too.

1814
01:32:40,302 --> 01:32:41,762
Most definitely.

1815
01:32:41,929 --> 01:32:43,681
I'll arrange.

1816
01:32:43,847 --> 01:32:45,391
Go see your boy.

1817
01:32:55,442 --> 01:32:57,194
This place is nice.

1818
01:32:57,236 --> 01:33:01,198
You're nice.
I figured I'd take you to a nice place,

1819
01:33:01,282 --> 01:33:03,409
- Ms. Record Executive.
- Mmm.

1820
01:33:03,492 --> 01:33:05,953
Um, record executive assistant.

1821
01:33:06,370 --> 01:33:07,663
But, damn.

1822
01:33:08,372 --> 01:33:12,001
I didn't realize we was going on
like a "date" date.

1823
01:33:12,501 --> 01:33:14,044
I don't even know how to take that.

1824
01:33:14,128 --> 01:33:17,381
I got my collared shirt on.
I brought you to this nice restaurant. Really?

1825
01:33:17,464 --> 01:33:20,217
Okay. That is not the
kind of collared shirt

1826
01:33:20,342 --> 01:33:21,760
they was talking about.

1827
01:33:21,844 --> 01:33:23,053
It's cute, though.

1828
01:33:23,137 --> 01:33:25,848
And you didn't take off
your hat like they asked you to.

1829
01:33:25,890 --> 01:33:27,224
And I'm not.

1830
01:33:27,308 --> 01:33:29,852
- Oh, really?
- I ain't taking off my hat for nobody.

1831
01:33:29,894 --> 01:33:31,937
I think they know that.

1832
01:33:32,021 --> 01:33:33,022
So what?

1833
01:33:33,480 --> 01:33:36,692
You bring all your little
females here, don't you?

1834
01:33:36,984 --> 01:33:38,402
The special ones.

1835
01:33:40,905 --> 01:33:41,906
Okay.

1836
01:33:43,407 --> 01:33:47,161
I'm playing. I'm playing.
There you go getting sensitive.

1837
01:33:47,494 --> 01:33:49,121
You don't have to try to impress me.

1838
01:33:49,622 --> 01:33:51,790
We could've went to Fatburger.

1839
01:33:52,249 --> 01:33:54,251
Go to Fatburger?

1840
01:33:54,752 --> 01:33:57,755
Hey! You got a haircut. I love it.

1841
01:33:58,756 --> 01:33:59,924
How's that new house treating you?

1842
01:34:00,007 --> 01:34:01,592
It's great. Thanks for asking.

1843
01:34:02,343 --> 01:34:05,346
So, how you liking your new decor?

1844
01:34:05,512 --> 01:34:06,513
Great.

1845
01:34:06,680 --> 01:34:08,599
Yeah, I never did like
the old design anyway, you know?

1846
01:34:08,766 --> 01:34:10,059
What you got for me, Bryan?

1847
01:34:10,100 --> 01:34:11,820
I know you called me up here for somethin'.

1848
01:34:13,270 --> 01:34:14,396
Yeah.

1849
01:34:14,772 --> 01:34:15,940
Uh...

1850
01:34:17,608 --> 01:34:19,193
It's N.W.A's new record.

1851
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:23,155
I wanted to play it for you first,
before you hear it anywhere else.

1852
01:34:24,448 --> 01:34:26,742
<i>Break me, take me
But watch me pull the trigger</i>

1853
01:34:26,784 --> 01:34:29,036
<i>Dre is just a nigga with
heart a nigga that's smart</i>

1854
01:34:29,119 --> 01:34:31,789
<i>A nigga that's paid to say
what others are scared to play</i>

1855
01:34:31,830 --> 01:34:35,334
<i>We started out with too much cargo
So I'm glad we got rid of Benedict Arnold</i>

1856
01:34:35,459 --> 01:34:36,585
<i>Yo, N.W...</i>

1857
01:34:36,794 --> 01:34:37,962
Benedict Arnold?

1858
01:34:39,797 --> 01:34:41,757
Are they trying to say
that you're like a traitor?

01:38:13,677 --> 01:38:17,348
Fine, you do that.
You call Dre, and you guys go do that.

1940
01:38:17,514 --> 01:38:18,807

So, wassup?

1993
01:42:01,363 --> 01:42:05,367
When you talked to me on the phone, man,
you sounded pretty worked up.

Yeah, I know you don't

It's about Jerry.
We gotta get rid of that motherfucker, E.

1996
01:42:18,047 --> 01:42:20,132
That's really why you came here?

1997
01:42:20,925 --> 01:42:23,510
I thought all this shit
was in the past, Dre.

1998
01:42:26,180 --> 01:42:29,600
I found some real shit, man. And the shit's

Do you even know why you rich, though?

ain't sleepin' on your
auntie's couch no more?

2003
01:42:39,109 --> 01:42:41,695
Because Jerry made that possible for us.

2004
01:42:41,862 --> 01:42:44,782
He kicked down the door
for that shit to happen. For us!

2005
01:42:44,949 --> 01:42:46,951
And you just gonna turn your back on him?
What, you Cube now?

2006
01:42:47,034 --> 01:42:48,577
Cube was right, fool!

2007
01:42:50,120 --> 01:42:53,624

You keep talking about Jerry this, Jerry that.

2009
01:42:58,254 --> 01:43:01,715
We didn't make it because of Jerry,
we made it because our shit is dope!

2010
01:43:03,717 --> 01:43:05,427
And we can keep going, E.

2011
01:43:05,469 --> 01:43:09,682
We can own the goddamn world,
but we just can't be fucking with him no more.

2012
01:43:11,934 --> 01:43:14,478
Man, we started this N.W.A shit.

2013
01:43:17,314 --> 01:43:18,941
I just want it to be right.

2014
01:43:19,775 --> 01:43:21,652
And this what you think right?

2015
01:43:22,695 --> 01:43:25,364
Turnin' your back on somebody
after all he done for us.

2016
01:43:26,073 --> 01:43:28,033
You mean all he done for you.

2017
01:43:29,326 --> 01:43:30,411
Right?

2018
01:43:32,371 --> 01:43:33,455
Look at me.

2019
01:43:36,166 --> 01:43:37,293
Look at me.

2020
01:43:42,006 --> 01:43:43,340
When Tyree died,

2021
01:43:46,093 --> 01:43:48,262
you said we was always gonna be brothers.

2022
01:43:50,306 --> 01:43:52,433
I guess you forgot about that.

2023
01:43:55,519 --> 01:43:57,897
I'mma start my own company
with Suge Knight, E.

2024
01:44:12,036 --> 01:44:14,121
Thought we were brothers, man.

2025
01:44:41,815 --> 01:44:43,025
What up, Dre?

2026
01:44:43,067 --> 01:44:45,194
This Death Row. We about to do this shit.

2027
01:44:51,575 --> 01:44:53,410
This shit sound good.

2028
01:44:54,036 --> 01:44:58,541
Yeah. None of it means anything
while I'm under contract with Ruthless.

2029
01:44:59,083 --> 01:45:01,043
I told you about that.

2030
01:45:01,210 --> 01:45:03,671
I'mma get you outta your contracts,
I promise you.

2031
01:45:05,089 --> 01:45:06,507
Yeah, ar'ight.

2032
01:45:12,721 --> 01:45:14,181
What up with you, cuz?

2033
01:45:14,348 --> 01:45:15,766
Wuddup?

2034
01:45:15,933 --> 01:45:17,017
What up, Lo?

2035
01:45:17,101 --> 01:45:18,310
Wuddup, Dre?

2036
01:45:18,435 --> 01:45:20,521
- Wassup, Warren?
- Chilin' man.

2037
01:45:20,688 --> 01:45:22,008
- You good?
- I'm great. You good?

2038
01:45:22,106 --> 01:45:23,607
- All right.
- Dr. Dre.

2039
01:45:23,774 --> 01:45:25,442
- 'Sup?
- Wuddup with you?

2040
01:45:25,526 --> 01:45:26,610
What's goin' on, man?

2041
01:45:26,819 --> 01:45:27,903
Yeah, yeah.

2042
01:45:27,987 --> 01:45:30,447
So, look, I listened to your demo.

2043
01:45:31,198 --> 01:45:32,575
It was tight.

2044
01:45:33,909 --> 01:45:36,287
You see that little look he gave me?

2045
01:45:36,453 --> 01:45:39,790
Yo, yo, yo, hold up.
Who the fuck is this guy?

2046
01:45:39,957 --> 01:45:42,209
My bad, Suge. This the homie, Snoop.

2047
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:45,296
Snoop D-O-double-G, cuz. Who you?

2048
01:45:45,462 --> 01:45:46,755
What? What up?

2049
01:45:46,922 --> 01:45:48,299
What the fuck you say, Blood?

2050
01:45:48,465 --> 01:45:51,594
Hold on! Hold on, hold on.
He with me. He with me.

2051
01:45:52,553 --> 01:45:53,637
He ain't with me.

2052
01:45:53,721 --> 01:45:57,141
Nah! He here to work, ar'ight?
This is business, Suge. Come on, man.

2053
01:45:57,308 --> 01:46:00,144
Anyway, what's this
you workin' on, cuz, I like this.

2054
01:46:00,311 --> 01:46:01,937
So look, you know...

2055
01:46:01,979 --> 01:46:04,607
It's a new track for this new movie.
It's called <i>Deep Cover.</i>

2056
01:46:05,900 --> 01:46:07,067
- Woo-wee.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

2057
01:46:07,234 --> 01:46:08,986
- For a movie, huh?
- Yeah, a movie.

2058
01:46:09,153 --> 01:46:11,488
Dre doing big shit. Okay, okay, okay.

2059
01:46:11,655 --> 01:46:13,699
You think you can get down on it?

2060
01:46:13,782 --> 01:46:17,161
Oh, most definitely.
Throw me in the booth one time.

2061
01:46:17,828 --> 01:46:18,996
All right.

2062
01:46:24,168 --> 01:46:27,504
<i>It's perhaps the most notorious
police brutality case in recent memory.</i>

2063
01:46:27,671 --> 01:46:31,508
<i>Those blows from
Officer Powell and Officer Wind's batons</i>

2064
01:46:31,675 --> 01:46:37,431
<i>continued and continued for no just reason.</i>

2065
01:46:37,640 --> 01:46:39,892
They just let them people do
whatever the hell they want.

2066
01:46:41,268 --> 01:46:43,646
<i>Rodney King's leg
and facial bones were broken.</i>

2067
01:46:43,687 --> 01:46:47,942
<i>Three of the four accused officers took
the stand and admitted that it was brutal,</i>

2068
01:46:48,108 --> 01:46:51,028
<i>but said, "Police work is brutal."
And that the video tape only showed that.</i>

2069
01:46:51,070 --> 01:46:52,238
Here.

2070
01:46:52,321 --> 01:46:54,156
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

2071
01:46:54,323 --> 01:46:55,699
You watchin' this shit upstairs?

2072
01:46:55,866 --> 01:46:56,867
Hello?

2073
01:46:56,951 --> 01:46:58,035
<i>Yo, it's Suge.</i>

2074
01:46:58,077 --> 01:46:59,517
<i>We gotta talk about these contracts.</i>

2075
01:46:59,870 --> 01:47:01,789
Why you don't talk to
Jerry about that shit?

2076
01:47:01,956 --> 01:47:06,001
<i>I don't wanna talk to Jerry.
It's your company. You the man.</i>

2077
01:47:06,544 --> 01:47:11,090
Ar'ight. Whatever, man.
I'll be through there.

2078
01:47:14,718 --> 01:47:16,637
- Who was that?
- Nobody.

2079
01:47:16,804 --> 01:47:18,444
<i>...right across the top of the cheekbone,</i>

2080
01:47:18,514 --> 01:47:20,808
<i>splitting his face
from the top of his ear to his chin.</i>

2081
01:47:28,732 --> 01:47:29,733
Where Dre at?

2082
01:47:30,734 --> 01:47:32,069
You said he was gonna be here.

2083
01:47:32,236 --> 01:47:34,655
I'll get with you outside.

2084
01:47:34,822 --> 01:47:36,782
Don't worry about Dre.

2085
01:47:36,949 --> 01:47:40,244
Truth be told,
he got nothing to do with this.

2086
01:47:46,333 --> 01:47:48,085
This what's gonna happen.

2087
01:47:49,587 --> 01:47:53,841
You gonna sign these,
releasing Dre and D.O.C. from Ruthless.

2088
01:47:58,637 --> 01:48:00,097
Whatever, homie.

2089
01:48:03,601 --> 01:48:06,478
Think I'm signing that?
You crazier than I thought you was.

2090
01:48:06,645 --> 01:48:07,855
I'm out.

2091
01:48:12,109 --> 01:48:14,278
Get your ass up.

2092
01:48:14,445 --> 01:48:17,781
Nah. I think you're gonna
stay here for a while.

2093
01:48:17,948 --> 01:48:21,493
Fuck you, Suge!
Y'all niggas don't scare me.

2094
01:48:21,577 --> 01:48:25,956
You can talk tough all you want,
but this ain't no record.

2095
01:48:26,832 --> 01:48:28,500
Don't make me change you, Eric.

2096
01:48:28,667 --> 01:48:30,169
Fuck that's supposed to mean?

2097
01:48:30,336 --> 01:48:32,630
Keep talkin',
you're gonna fuck around and get smoked.

2098
01:48:32,796 --> 01:48:35,799
Nah, nah.
But you better choose right.

2099
01:48:35,966 --> 01:48:39,803
You know where the fuck I'm from.
This Bompton, nigga.

2100
01:49:06,997 --> 01:49:08,832
Oh, my fucking God.

2101
01:49:09,500 --> 01:49:10,626
Eric.

2102
01:49:11,168 --> 01:49:12,920
Jesus Christ.

2103
01:49:13,420 --> 01:49:17,800
What the hell are you doing here?
You can't sneak in here like that.

2104
01:49:18,008 --> 01:49:19,843
I thought you were...

2105
01:49:21,345 --> 01:49:24,515
Oh, my God. What's going on, man?
Are you okay?

2106
01:49:26,350 --> 01:49:27,810
What happened to your face?

2107
01:49:27,851 --> 01:49:30,563
I gotta kill this motherfucker,
Suge Knight.

2108
01:49:32,356 --> 01:49:35,150
I just came here to let you know,

2109
01:49:35,192 --> 01:49:38,821
'cause shit might get a little thick.
I need to stay protected.

2110
01:49:39,697 --> 01:49:42,992
No, you're not gonna do that. No.

2111
01:49:43,033 --> 01:49:45,327
I didn't come here to ask for permission.

2112
01:49:45,619 --> 01:49:47,788
I came here to let you know.

2113
01:49:48,372 --> 01:49:50,583
You wanted to be involved
with this gangster shit?

2114
01:49:51,041 --> 01:49:52,084
Here we go.

2115
01:49:52,167 --> 01:49:55,379
You do that and you're gonna ruin
everything we've worked for.

2116
01:49:58,340 --> 01:50:00,384
You really think I got a fucking choice?

2117
01:50:00,467 --> 01:50:02,052
Look at my face!

2118
01:50:04,179 --> 01:50:06,724
This the streets. Motherfuckers came at me!

2119
01:50:06,765 --> 01:50:09,101
Came at us!

2120
01:50:09,184 --> 01:50:11,061
If I don't hit back, we finished.
It's over.

2121
01:50:11,103 --> 01:50:13,022
I'm not saying that we're
not gonna hit back.

2122
01:50:13,063 --> 01:50:15,065
But this is not Compton,

2123
01:50:16,275 --> 01:50:17,776
if you haven't looked around.

2124
01:50:17,860 --> 01:50:20,112
Drop that shit, okay?

2125
01:50:20,738 --> 01:50:23,741
We don't hit back with bullets,
we hit back with lawyers.

2126
01:50:23,782 --> 01:50:25,159
We drain these assholes.

2127
01:50:25,242 --> 01:50:27,453
That really takes 'em down.

2128
01:50:27,536 --> 01:50:29,371
It ain't about the money, Jerry!

2129
01:50:31,040 --> 01:50:32,374
I don't care about no money.

2130
01:50:32,416 --> 01:50:35,252
Of course it is. And you should
fucking care about the money.

2131
01:50:36,420 --> 01:50:39,423
You're so much smarter
than these fuckin' thugs.

2132
01:50:39,465 --> 01:50:40,966
You wanna kill somebody?

2133
01:50:41,050 --> 01:50:42,801
You're gonna go to jail forever.

2134
01:50:45,930 --> 01:50:48,557
No more family,
no more Ruthless, no more anything.

2135
01:50:48,599 --> 01:50:50,768
If you kill this man,
his problems will be over

2136
01:50:50,809 --> 01:50:53,312
and yours will just be beginning.

2137
01:50:53,395 --> 01:50:55,314
Don't be a fuckin' fool.

2138
01:50:56,232 --> 01:50:57,233
Hey.

2139
01:50:58,776 --> 01:51:01,654
Why the fuck I gotta be the bigger man?

2140
01:51:02,613 --> 01:51:04,448
'Cause it's better than
you being a dead man.

2141
01:51:04,907 --> 01:51:07,243
I don't want you fuckin' dead.

2142
01:51:45,239 --> 01:51:46,574
You okay?

2143
01:51:52,663 --> 01:51:54,248
Baby. Let me see.

2144
01:53:04,985 --> 01:53:07,404
- Why you so tense, Dre?
- No, I'm cool.

2145
01:53:08,405 --> 01:53:09,782
Man. No, you're not, man.

2146
01:53:09,865 --> 01:53:11,700
You've been in that house, what?
A month now?

2147
01:53:11,742 --> 01:53:14,245
Nigga, and not one track?
I mean, what's up?

2148
01:53:14,870 --> 01:53:16,747
There's too much interference.

2149
01:53:16,789 --> 01:53:19,250
Man, you know how they
tryin' to starve me out.

2150
01:53:19,625 --> 01:53:21,544
Playin' games with
my motherfuckin' money, man.

2151
01:53:21,585 --> 01:53:24,129
That's why the house
was so goddamned empty.

2152
01:53:25,256 --> 01:53:28,342
- Hey, come on, man.
- I'm fucking with you, cuz. Hit this.

2153
01:53:29,134 --> 01:53:31,178
- All right, man, give me that shit.
- Here.

2154
01:53:31,262 --> 01:53:33,097
Fuck I'm taking about.

2155
01:53:34,306 --> 01:53:36,767
Have you feeling righteously together.

2156
01:53:39,436 --> 01:53:40,437
- Holy shit.
- Oh, hell no. Give me that.

2157
01:53:40,521 --> 01:53:44,567
Goddamn, man!
What the fuck is in this shit, Snoops?

2158
01:53:45,025 --> 01:53:48,112
- That right there, that's that chronic, cuz.
- Yeah.

2159
01:53:49,321 --> 01:53:51,323
- Chronic.
- Yes, sir.

2160
01:53:51,407 --> 01:53:53,325
- Let me hit that once.
- Yeah.

2161
01:53:53,409 --> 01:53:55,995
- Look it.
- Wow, man.

2162
01:53:57,204 --> 01:54:00,165
- All right. Let's head back to the studio.
- Let's go.

2163
01:54:00,249 --> 01:54:01,542
I got something for this.

2164
01:54:23,188 --> 01:54:26,191
Damn, Dre.
What the fuck is that? Feeling that shit.

2165
01:54:26,275 --> 01:54:27,651
- Yeah. You feelin' it?
- Yeah!

2166
01:54:27,693 --> 01:54:29,862
Hey, hey, look,
I'mma spit a little something.

2167
01:54:29,945 --> 01:54:30,946
You feel me? You say whatever...

2168
01:54:30,988 --> 01:54:32,323
You just jump in, nigga, and just...

2169
01:54:32,364 --> 01:54:34,084
Hold on, look, I got something. Here we go.

2170
01:54:35,618 --> 01:54:38,162
<i>One, two, three and to the four</i>

2171
01:54:38,204 --> 01:54:40,706
<i>Snoop Doggy Dogg and Dr. Dre is at the door</i>

2172
01:54:40,789 --> 01:54:43,083
<i>Ready to make an entrance so back on up</i>

2173
01:54:43,167 --> 01:54:45,002
<i>'Cause you know we about to rip shit up</i>

2174
01:54:45,044 --> 01:54:46,170
<i>Give me the microphone first</i>

2175
01:54:46,212 --> 01:54:47,838
<i>so I could bust like a bubble</i>

2176
01:54:47,922 --> 01:54:49,506
<i>Compton and Long Beach together</i>

2177
01:54:49,548 --> 01:54:50,758
<i>now you know you in trouble</i>

2178
01:54:50,841 --> 01:54:53,344
<i>Ain't nothin' but a G thang, baby</i>

2179
01:54:53,427 --> 01:54:55,846
<i>Two loc'ed out niggas so we're crazy</i>

2180
01:54:55,930 --> 01:54:58,641
<i>Death Row is the label that pays me</i>

2181
01:54:58,682 --> 01:55:01,101
<i>Un-fadable so please
don't try and fade this</i>

2182
01:55:01,185 --> 01:55:03,604
<i>But back to the lecture at hand</i>

2183
01:55:03,687 --> 01:55:04,897
<i>Perfection is perfected...</i>

2184
01:55:04,980 --> 01:55:06,607
I want to thank you
for having us here.

2185
01:55:06,690 --> 01:55:09,210
- Of course.
- Very generous for you to give your time

2186
01:55:09,276 --> 01:55:11,612
with everything that's going on right now.

2187
01:55:11,695 --> 01:55:12,988
Not a problem.

2188
01:55:13,030 --> 01:55:14,573
Now if I may,

2189
01:55:15,866 --> 01:55:17,201
are you anti-Semitic?

2190
01:55:18,911 --> 01:55:20,951
Now, I thought
this was about the Rodney King trial.

2191
01:55:21,205 --> 01:55:23,040
Well, the JDL recently got involved

2192
01:55:23,123 --> 01:55:26,001
citing the lyrics about
your former manager Jerry Heller.

2193
01:55:26,043 --> 01:55:29,588
I'm not anti-Semitic.
I'm anti-Jerry Heller.

2194
01:55:29,880 --> 01:55:30,881
Let me ask you something.

2195
01:55:30,965 --> 01:55:34,635
Do the JDL condone Jerry's behavior
when it comes to my situation?

2196
01:55:34,718 --> 01:55:37,471
Him trying to get me to sign a contract
without legal representation?

2197
01:55:38,138 --> 01:55:39,223
I have no idea.

2198
01:55:39,265 --> 01:55:40,724
I didn't think you did.

2199
01:55:40,766 --> 01:55:43,686
But when you got that for me,
we can continue on this topic.

2200
01:55:43,727 --> 01:55:48,899
Until then, I'm here to talk about the
beating of an unarmed motorist, Rodney King.

2201
01:55:48,983 --> 01:55:54,238
And four guilty LAPD officers
who seem to be Daryl Gates' standard issue.

2202
01:55:55,614 --> 01:55:57,741
It's also the LAPD and the FBI

2203
01:55:57,783 --> 01:56:00,828
who feel that your negative portrayal
of police condones violence.

2204
01:56:00,911 --> 01:56:03,831
"Fuck Tha Police" is just a warning,
that's it.

2205
01:56:03,914 --> 01:56:07,251
You can't treat people like that
and expect 'em not to rise up.

2206
01:56:07,585 --> 01:56:09,545
I'm a journalist just like you.

2207
01:56:09,587 --> 01:56:11,505
Reporting what's goin' on in the hood.

2208
01:56:11,589 --> 01:56:14,592
The only thing that's different
is that I'm brutally honest.

2209
01:56:17,052 --> 01:56:19,430
What's your relationship
with the Nation of Islam?

2210
01:56:20,431 --> 01:56:21,932
They my brothers.

2211
01:56:21,974 --> 01:56:24,101
You know what?
That question right there proves to me

2212
01:56:24,143 --> 01:56:26,979
what kind of a unprepared
sandbag reporter you are.

2213
01:56:27,438 --> 01:56:29,273
You talkin' to me
like I'm some elected official.

2214
01:56:29,315 --> 01:56:31,400
Like I'm running for office.

2215
01:56:31,442 --> 01:56:33,319
But I get it, that's your job.

2216
01:56:33,402 --> 01:56:35,821
Bigger the story,
the bigger the check in your field of work.

2217
01:56:36,363 --> 01:56:38,963
It's not your fault, I shouldn't blame you.
What's your name, man?

2218
01:56:40,034 --> 01:56:41,118
Brian.

2219
01:56:41,160 --> 01:56:44,163
Eat a dick, Brian.
Get the fuck out my house. Y'all done here.

2220
01:56:45,080 --> 01:56:46,457
Can we cut, please?

2221
01:57:57,903 --> 01:58:00,197
Excuse me, excuse me,
excuse me, excuse me.

2222
01:58:00,239 --> 01:58:01,448
You look like you ready to go.

2223
01:58:01,532 --> 01:58:04,702
Yeah. I'm just waiting on my friend.
I should've drove.

2224
01:58:04,785 --> 01:58:06,036
You're not havin' a good time?

2225
01:58:06,078 --> 01:58:08,289
No! No. I had a really good time,

2226
01:58:08,372 --> 01:58:11,041
but now it's starting to get a little wild.

2227
01:58:11,375 --> 01:58:12,376
Yeah.

2228
01:58:12,459 --> 01:58:14,712
We've been known to get crazy
from time to time.

2229
01:58:16,839 --> 01:58:17,840
I'm Andre.

2230
01:58:18,340 --> 01:58:19,884
I'm Nicole.

2231
01:58:21,594 --> 01:58:23,721
Come on, man. Lighten up.

2232
01:58:25,306 --> 01:58:28,392
We're about to get back in the game.
Big time.

2233
01:58:28,434 --> 01:58:29,852
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

2234
01:58:30,603 --> 01:58:31,604
How do you figure?

2235
01:58:32,605 --> 01:58:36,358
Are you trying to piss me off?
Come on. God almighty.

2236
01:58:36,567 --> 01:58:38,736
Did you forget about Ren's new album?

2237
01:58:38,819 --> 01:58:42,573
Or did you forget about the fact
that you are working on something

2238
01:58:42,615 --> 01:58:45,659
I think is gonna be bigger
than anything N.W.A ever did.

2239
01:58:45,743 --> 01:58:47,411
All I know... Mmm!

2240
01:58:49,121 --> 01:58:51,165
Fucking Cube out here,

2241
01:58:51,790 --> 01:58:54,793
- doing it big. Making movies and shit.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2242
01:58:54,877 --> 01:58:57,213
Then I keep hearing about
this album Dre about to drop.

2243
01:58:57,254 --> 01:59:00,132
Dre is a fucking producer, Eric.

2244
01:59:00,216 --> 01:59:02,218
Producers don't rap.

2245
01:59:02,259 --> 01:59:05,262
We have him under contract.
He can't do anything.

2246
01:59:05,554 --> 01:59:06,764
Cheer up.

2247
01:59:07,514 --> 01:59:09,516
Eat, drink and be merry.

2248
01:59:09,892 --> 01:59:10,976
- Suge.
- Hey.

2249
01:59:11,060 --> 01:59:12,895
- How you doin'?
- All right.

2250
01:59:12,937 --> 01:59:15,397
Jimmy Iovine, Interscope Records.
Nice to meet you.

2251
01:59:15,439 --> 01:59:16,440
You, too.

2252
01:59:16,523 --> 01:59:19,401
So, what do I call you?
Dre? Dr. Dre? Doc?

2253
01:59:20,611 --> 01:59:22,488
Nah, Dre is cool. Go ahead, have a seat.

2254
01:59:22,571 --> 01:59:23,572
All right.

2255
01:59:23,614 --> 01:59:24,657
- It's good.
- Yeah.

2256
01:59:24,740 --> 01:59:26,075
So what do you got today?

2257
01:59:26,116 --> 01:59:27,117
Um...

2258
01:59:27,952 --> 01:59:29,411
Well, you know...

2259
01:59:29,453 --> 01:59:33,749
I heard John McClain gave you my album.
What'd you think?

2260
01:59:34,124 --> 01:59:35,334
I think it was great.

2261
01:59:37,545 --> 01:59:40,965
So, you're the artist on the record.
Who produced it?

2262
01:59:42,132 --> 01:59:43,551
I did.

2263
01:59:43,634 --> 01:59:45,553
Okay. And who mixed it?

2264
01:59:45,761 --> 01:59:48,180
Come on, man. I did.

2265
01:59:49,515 --> 01:59:50,516
Huh.

2266
01:59:51,809 --> 01:59:52,810
Listen, um...

2267
01:59:53,227 --> 01:59:54,812
I don't know anything about hip-hop,

2268
01:59:54,979 --> 01:59:56,981
but I know that this is special.

2269
01:59:57,648 --> 01:59:58,816
Seriously.

2270
01:59:59,817 --> 02:00:00,818
Thank you.

2271
02:00:01,735 --> 02:00:03,695
Hey, look, we'd love
to bring in Interscope,

2272
02:00:04,029 --> 02:00:05,531
but there's a little problem.

2273
02:00:05,906 --> 02:00:06,991
What's the problem?

2274
02:00:07,074 --> 02:00:09,660
Ruthless, lawsuits,

2275
02:00:10,160 --> 02:00:11,453
and contracts.

2276
02:00:12,830 --> 02:00:13,831
How about this?

2277
02:00:14,415 --> 02:00:16,417
You give me three weeks
and I don't wanna hear any bullshit

2278
02:00:16,500 --> 02:00:18,419
about you shopping this
anywhere around town.

2279
02:00:18,794 --> 02:00:20,254
If you do that...

2280
02:00:21,672 --> 02:00:24,425
I believe I can solve your problem
with the contract.

2281
02:00:29,138 --> 02:00:30,681
Lil' nigga, you in my spot.

2282
02:00:31,974 --> 02:00:33,893
- Yo.
- Hey, Suge.

2283
02:00:34,602 --> 02:00:35,895
Suge. Easy, man. Yo.

2284
02:00:35,978 --> 02:00:36,979
Hey, Suge, what the...

2285
02:00:37,104 --> 02:00:38,480
Hey. Suge.

2286
02:00:38,522 --> 02:00:40,024
You parked in my
motherfuckin' spot or what?

2287
02:00:40,107 --> 02:00:41,734
- I didn't know, man.
- It's cool, man.

2288
02:00:42,610 --> 02:00:44,612
What the fuck? Suge!

2289
02:00:47,114 --> 02:00:48,574
Suge, it's just a parking spot.

2290
02:00:48,657 --> 02:00:50,284
Fuck off. Fuck out of my...

2291
02:00:54,538 --> 02:00:55,738
Move this piece of shit.

2292
02:00:58,292 --> 02:00:59,585
And park my car.

2293
02:01:00,794 --> 02:01:03,172
And I better not see
one drop of blood on that motherfucker.

2294
02:01:03,214 --> 02:01:04,840
Suge, let's go, man.

2295
02:01:07,343 --> 02:01:08,344
What?

2296
02:01:11,222 --> 02:01:14,266
<i>The jury in the Rodney King case
has delivered its verdict,</i>

2297
02:01:14,350 --> 02:01:17,102
<i>and not one of the four police officers</i>

2298

<i>seen on video tape
beating Mr. King a year ago</i>

2300

<i>They've all been found not guilty.</i>

2301
02:01:23,609 --> 02:01:26,403
For Christ's sake. Oh, my God.

2302
02:01:26,445 --> 02:01:27,529
<i>Judy, the details.</i>

2303
02:01:27,571 --> 02:01:29,782
<i>Peter, it was a clean sweep
for the defendants.</i>

2304
02:01:29,865 --> 02:01:31,700
<i>Not guilty, the verdict for all of them.</i>

2305
02:01:31,867 --> 02:01:32,952
<i>Only on one count against
Lawrence Powell...</i>

2306
02:01:33,035 --> 02:01:34,036
I'm sorry.

2307
02:01:34,078 --> 02:01:36,198
<i>...on excessive use of force
under color of authority.</i>

2308
02:01:40,626 --> 02:01:42,044
<i>It's probably the worst case</i>

2309
02:01:42,086 --> 02:01:44,171
<i>of police misconduct that I've ever seen.</i>

2310
02:01:45,923 --> 02:01:48,133
<i>I think it was devastating
to the image of this city</i>

2311
02:01:48,217 --> 02:01:49,817
<i>and especially to our police department.</i>

2312
02:01:51,428 --> 02:01:53,628
<i>It looks
kind of like we're in a war zone though.</i>

<i>We've got some courageous

a statement of political dissatisfaction.</i>

2315
02:02:01,897 --> 02:02:03,777
<i>Police officers
are still back down,</i>

2316
02:02:03,941 --> 02:02:06,402
<i>guarding the area
down there with the Ralph's...</i>

2317
02:02:06,443 --> 02:02:08,279
<i>The police
are using eerily reminiscent</i>

2318
02:02:08,320 --> 02:02:10,406
<i>of military-style assault weapons.</i>

2319
02:02:10,447 --> 02:02:12,825
<i>You can hear
random gunshots as rioters...</i>

2320
02:02:12,908 --> 02:02:14,285
<i>The cars
have been left abandoned</i>

2321
02:02:14,368 --> 02:02:16,954
<i>because their drivers came under attack...</i>

2322
02:02:20,124 --> 02:02:22,042
<i>...our city.
We have fires burning.</i>

2323
02:02:23,961 --> 02:02:26,046
<i>Olympic, Pico, Wilshire.</i>

2324
02:02:28,382 --> 02:02:29,800
<i>More than 100 injured,</i>

2325
02:02:29,842 --> 02:02:32,511
<i>mostly in the South-Central
section of Los Angeles.</i>

2326
02:03:06,212 --> 02:03:09,340
You know, If we bag all this shit up in ounces,
we should probably be straight.

2327
02:03:09,423 --> 02:03:11,175
I think we got enough.

2328
02:03:13,344 --> 02:03:15,596
No, turn it down. Turn it down.

2329
02:03:20,392 --> 02:03:23,103
Baby. Can you smoke that shit out there?

2330
02:03:25,522 --> 02:03:28,400
So, all this weed is for
your Ruthless artists?

2331
02:03:28,651 --> 02:03:30,486
Yeah, I mean, shit.

2332
02:03:31,695 --> 02:03:33,697
I'm tryin' to take care
of these little money problems, man.

2333
02:03:33,739 --> 02:03:36,158
So, they can smoke it, sell it.

2334
02:03:36,200 --> 02:03:37,826
Fuck, throw a party on it,
for all I give a fuck.

2335
02:03:37,868 --> 02:03:39,203
As long as I just...

2336
02:03:42,122 --> 02:03:43,322
Yo, man, you straight?

2337
02:03:44,124 --> 02:03:46,043
- E, you straight?
- Yeah, I'm good.

2338
02:03:46,126 --> 02:03:48,126
- No, for real, man. You straight?
- Man, I'm good!

2339
02:03:49,171 --> 02:03:50,422
I'm just fucking tired, man.

2340
02:03:50,506 --> 02:03:53,217
I'm fucking downgrading houses.
How would you feel?

2341
02:03:53,509 --> 02:03:54,802
Answer me that!

2342
02:03:54,885 --> 02:03:57,012
Dre rolled out. Ruthless money low.

2343
02:03:57,054 --> 02:03:59,431
Tomica asking me all kind of questions
about the house.

2344
02:04:00,057 --> 02:04:02,810
Answer me this, would you be all right?

2345
02:04:03,185 --> 02:04:05,521
Would you be all right
moving out your fucking house?

2346
02:04:05,563 --> 02:04:06,730
You all right with it?

2347
02:04:06,814 --> 02:04:10,025
E, I'm your boy. I'm in this shit with you.

2348
02:04:10,067 --> 02:04:11,694
I'm just trying to make
sure you're good, bro.

2349
02:04:11,735 --> 02:04:13,571
I'm good! You good?

2350
02:04:13,654 --> 02:04:14,974
- You good?
- Yeah, man.

2351
02:04:15,364 --> 02:04:16,490
Eric.

2352
02:04:16,574 --> 02:04:17,616
What, Jerry?

2353
02:04:17,700 --> 02:04:18,951
Take it easy.

2354
02:04:19,034 --> 02:04:20,995
You know what?
Let's get you outta the house.

2355
02:04:21,078 --> 02:04:23,122
I have stuff needs your autograph, okay?

2356
02:04:24,373 --> 02:04:25,958
I'll come when I have time, Jerry.

2357
02:04:26,041 --> 02:04:27,751
Eric, come on.

2358
02:04:30,212 --> 02:04:31,589
We still got a business to run.

2359
02:04:31,672 --> 02:04:33,299
Don't it look like
I'm running business right now?

2360
02:04:33,382 --> 02:04:35,092
No. It looks like
you're fucking cutting up weed.

2361
02:04:35,134 --> 02:04:38,596
I thought that was a job
for fucking jackasses.

2362
02:04:40,890 --> 02:04:42,516
You know what, Jerry?

2363
02:04:44,059 --> 02:04:47,771
You right. You absolutely fuckin' right.

2364
02:04:48,731 --> 02:04:50,858
We got business to take care of.

2365
02:04:51,901 --> 02:04:53,944
I'll see you in a minute.

2366
02:05:03,245 --> 02:05:04,872
You all right, E?

2367
02:05:05,789 --> 02:05:07,291
E, are you cool?

2368
02:05:09,793 --> 02:05:11,545
Eric.

2369
02:05:18,135 --> 02:05:22,348
"You got knocked the fuck out."

2370
02:05:25,476 --> 02:05:26,894
That shit's funny.

2371
02:05:26,977 --> 02:05:28,270
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, baby.

2372
02:05:28,312 --> 02:05:29,897
How's <i>Friday</i> coming?

2373
02:05:29,980 --> 02:05:33,317
This shit is funny. I'm feeling it, though.

2374
02:05:34,276 --> 02:05:35,486
What page are you on?

2375
02:05:35,653 --> 02:05:38,989
100. I'm not going too much longer, though.

2376
02:05:39,073 --> 02:05:40,407
Baby, come here. Look!

2377
02:05:43,160 --> 02:05:45,162
Look how young y'all are.

2378
02:05:48,666 --> 02:05:49,667
Shit.

2379
02:05:52,044 --> 02:05:53,379
Dang!

2380
02:05:53,837 --> 02:05:55,089
What?

2381
02:05:55,839 --> 02:05:58,259
We left a lot of good records on the table.

2382
02:06:34,253 --> 02:06:36,964
<i>It's like
I don't even know what I'm doing no more.</i>

2383
02:06:37,840 --> 02:06:39,717
I don't know where the money going.

2384
02:06:39,925 --> 02:06:41,552
Why you stressin'?

2385
02:06:41,635 --> 02:06:43,554
You know I know the business.

2386
02:06:44,179 --> 02:06:45,890
Just... Shit.

2387
02:06:45,973 --> 02:06:48,684
Lay out all the files,
contracts, whatever it is,

2388
02:06:48,726 --> 02:06:50,603
and I'll look into it.

2389
02:06:51,186 --> 02:06:53,397
For real. Come here.

2390
02:06:55,566 --> 02:06:57,234
Come here.

2391
02:07:03,908 --> 02:07:06,452
You just go to New York,

2392
02:07:06,535 --> 02:07:11,332
you take care of this
big ol' distribution deal with Sony.

2393
02:07:11,415 --> 02:07:13,375
Bring that shit on in.

2394
02:07:14,460 --> 02:07:18,088
All right?
And I'll check into everything else.

2395
02:07:22,593 --> 02:07:23,761
I love you.

2396
02:07:23,802 --> 02:07:24,803
You what?

2397
02:07:25,262 --> 02:07:26,430
I love you.

2398
02:07:26,472 --> 02:07:29,099
You what? I can't hear you.

2399
02:07:32,061 --> 02:07:34,271
So how's your home life, man?

2400
02:07:35,189 --> 02:07:37,816
What? That small-ass house
I just moved into in Norwalk?

2401
02:07:37,900 --> 02:07:39,193
Fuckin' hate it.

2402
02:07:39,276 --> 02:07:41,737
No, come on. You know what I mean.

2403
02:07:41,779 --> 02:07:44,698
I mean your love life, Eric. Hmm?

2404
02:07:45,866 --> 02:07:48,536
You seem pretty serious about this girl.

2405
02:07:48,619 --> 02:07:52,414
- I ain't in love.
- Oh? You had me scared there for a minute.

2406
02:07:52,456 --> 02:07:54,542
You're too young to settle down.

2407
02:07:54,625 --> 02:07:56,210
Well, you don't have to be scared of that.

2408
02:07:56,293 --> 02:07:58,462
Oh, man. Wait till you taste this.

2409
02:07:58,546 --> 02:08:00,798
Kung Pao chicken.

2410
02:08:00,839 --> 02:08:02,299
Fantastic.

2411
02:08:02,383 --> 02:08:04,802
And it is better the second day.

2412
02:08:05,261 --> 02:08:06,804
There you go.

2413
02:08:07,221 --> 02:08:08,222
Dig in.

2414
02:08:11,517 --> 02:08:14,311
So, where is this girl from again?

2415
02:08:16,772 --> 02:08:18,649
Look, Jerry.

2416
02:08:18,691 --> 02:08:20,484
I actually ate right before I came.

2417
02:08:20,526 --> 02:08:23,112
So I'm just gonna take this and go.

2418
02:08:23,237 --> 02:08:25,990
Hold on. Hold on. Where are you going?

2419
02:08:26,031 --> 02:08:27,825
I just came to get this.

2420
02:08:28,242 --> 02:08:29,785
These are my bills, my checks.

2421
02:08:29,827 --> 02:08:32,496
Look, I'm gonna have a bite of your food.

2422
02:08:34,081 --> 02:08:36,041
I'm gonna say farewell.

2423
02:08:39,086 --> 02:08:41,714
I'll talk to you later.

2424
02:08:51,223 --> 02:08:53,684
Your neighbors,
they've been complaining a lot.

2425
02:08:53,767 --> 02:08:54,810
The noise.

2426
02:08:54,852 --> 02:08:56,687
Stop.

2427
02:08:57,354 --> 02:08:59,690
I just think a little
privacy would be better.

2428
02:09:01,358 --> 02:09:03,444
So what? You want me to move?

2429
02:09:04,361 --> 02:09:05,362
Yeah.

2430
02:09:06,363 --> 02:09:09,241
And I...
You know, I happen to know of a place.

2431
02:09:09,325 --> 02:09:11,869
There's plenty of room,
and I know the owner.

2432
02:09:13,787 --> 02:09:15,873
Are you sure you're ready for that, Andre?

2433
02:09:15,915 --> 02:09:17,333
Yeah, I am.

2434
02:09:18,209 --> 02:09:20,920
'Cause I'm really feeling you like that.

2435
02:09:23,088 --> 02:09:25,549
I'm really feeling you too.

2436
02:09:26,717 --> 02:09:27,885
But...

2437
02:09:34,099 --> 02:09:37,728
Hey, don't even worry about it.
It was just a thought.

2438
02:09:41,899 --> 02:09:42,983
What's up?

2439
02:09:43,567 --> 02:09:46,695
All right. Good night.

2440
02:09:46,737 --> 02:09:49,490
Oh, whoa, whoa! Really? Good night?

2441
02:09:50,074 --> 02:09:51,158
You okay to drive?

2442
02:09:53,160 --> 02:09:54,828
No. Look at you.

2443
02:09:55,996 --> 02:09:57,081
Good night, Andre.

2444
02:09:57,164 --> 02:09:58,666
Nah. See...

2445
02:09:59,333 --> 02:10:00,459
See, I can't help thinking,

2446
02:10:00,543 --> 02:10:03,045
maybe you want me to come inside.

2447
02:10:03,087 --> 02:10:04,380
Of course I do.

2448
02:10:04,421 --> 02:10:05,839
So, what's different now?

2449
02:10:07,216 --> 02:10:09,760
I got a lot to think about.

2450
02:10:09,843 --> 02:10:11,971
You're asking me to move in with you.

2451
02:10:12,054 --> 02:10:13,764
That is a huge step!

2452
02:10:14,682 --> 02:10:15,683
I like you, Andre,

2453
02:10:15,766 --> 02:10:18,269
but there's a lot going on around you.

2454
02:10:19,186 --> 02:10:20,771
Whatchu mean?

2455
02:10:21,605 --> 02:10:24,650
I know about the whole Death Row business,

2456
02:10:24,733 --> 02:10:25,901
the assault charges,

2457
02:10:25,943 --> 02:10:27,528
the shooting.

2458
02:10:27,611 --> 02:10:29,947
Just seems dangerous.

2459
02:10:30,030 --> 02:10:32,700
My son is my world.

2460
02:10:36,620 --> 02:10:38,289
I hear you.

2461
02:10:44,628 --> 02:10:46,046
Good night.

2462
02:11:04,106 --> 02:11:06,650
<i>Hail Mary, run quick see</i>

2463
02:11:06,692 --> 02:11:09,153
<i>What do we have here now?</i>

2464
02:11:09,194 --> 02:11:11,030
<i>Do you wanna ride or die?</i>

2465
02:11:13,991 --> 02:11:16,035
<i>I ain't a killer but don't push me</i>

2466
02:11:16,118 --> 02:11:18,829
<i>Revenge is like
the sweetest joy next to getting pussy</i>

2467
02:11:18,871 --> 02:11:22,333
<i>Picture paragraphs unloaded
Wise words being quoted</i>

2468
02:11:22,374 --> 02:11:24,627
<i>Peeped the weakness
in the rap game and sewed it</i>

2469
02:11:24,710 --> 02:11:27,671
<i>Bow down, pray to God
Hoping that he's listening</i>

2470
02:11:27,755 --> 02:11:30,174
<i>Seeing niggas coming for me
and my diamonds...</i>

2471
02:11:31,842 --> 02:11:33,042
What up, Dre?

2472
02:11:33,427 --> 02:11:34,428
What up, Pac?

2473
02:11:34,595 --> 02:11:36,680
I'm about to bust niggas in the mouth
with this new album.

2474
02:11:36,764 --> 02:11:38,515
Okay, I feel that.

2475
02:11:38,641 --> 02:11:41,018
- Suge said you got some heat for a nigga.
- Hell yeah!

2476
02:11:41,101 --> 02:11:42,770
- Play that for him.
- Okay.

2477
02:11:43,687 --> 02:11:45,814
<i>California Love</i>

2478
02:11:52,029 --> 02:11:53,614
Yeah. You feel that?

2479
02:11:54,448 --> 02:11:55,741
Yeah. Fuck with me.

2480
02:11:55,824 --> 02:11:56,825
<i>California...</i>

2481
02:11:56,867 --> 02:11:58,619
<i>- "California Love."</i>
- Yeah.

2482
02:11:58,702 --> 02:12:01,163
<i>...knows how to party</i>

2483
02:12:01,205 --> 02:12:02,373
<i>California...</i>

2484
02:12:03,666 --> 02:12:05,668
<i>...knows how to party</i>

2485
02:12:06,710 --> 02:12:08,546
What the hell was that?

2486
02:12:08,629 --> 02:12:09,630
Hold on, Pac.

2487
02:12:10,214 --> 02:12:11,882
Stay right there, man.

2488
02:12:14,802 --> 02:12:16,387
Yo. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.

2489
02:12:18,347 --> 02:12:20,474
- Come on.
- Come on, man.

2490
02:12:20,558 --> 02:12:23,519
Shut the fuck up
and put your glasses down.

2491
02:12:24,895 --> 02:12:26,355
Stop, man! Stop.

2492
02:12:28,065 --> 02:12:29,233
Chop, chop.

2493
02:12:29,817 --> 02:12:30,818
Get him. Get hype.

2494
02:12:31,151 --> 02:12:32,152
Get hype.

2495
02:12:33,070 --> 02:12:34,071
Yo!

2496
02:12:35,906 --> 02:12:37,867
What the fuck are y'all doing?

2497
02:12:39,034 --> 02:12:40,035
Check this out.

2498
02:12:40,452 --> 02:12:42,663
Get him. Time to eat. Who's hungry?

2499
02:12:42,746 --> 02:12:44,164
You hungry, nigga? Yeah!

2500
02:12:44,248 --> 02:12:45,666
- Get up.
- Come on!

2501
02:12:47,418 --> 02:12:49,178
Bring your bitch-ass up.

2502
02:12:50,254 --> 02:12:51,694
Tight-whitey ass nigga.

2503
02:12:53,591 --> 02:12:55,092
You know what to do.

2504
02:12:59,763 --> 02:13:00,890
I'd like to make a toast.

2505
02:13:01,265 --> 02:13:02,266
To what?

2506
02:13:02,433 --> 02:13:03,601
To Death Row Records...

2507
02:13:04,184 --> 02:13:05,269
Death Row!

2508
02:13:05,352 --> 02:13:06,604
...and Suge

2509
02:13:06,854 --> 02:13:08,397
for making all this happen.

2510
02:13:11,191 --> 02:13:13,694
And may the West Coast reign forever.

2511
02:13:14,445 --> 02:13:15,779
Come on. Come on.

2512
02:13:17,364 --> 02:13:19,450
And may the West Coast reign forever.

2513
02:13:20,242 --> 02:13:22,077
Now toast to Dr. Dre.

2514
02:13:22,620 --> 02:13:23,954
Put your glass down.

2515
02:13:25,789 --> 02:13:27,708
I said, put the fucking glasses down!

2516
02:13:27,791 --> 02:13:29,084
Hey, yo, slow your roll, Dre.

2517
02:13:29,251 --> 02:13:30,377
Come on.

2518
02:13:30,461 --> 02:13:31,712
This why we got money?

2519
02:13:32,796 --> 02:13:34,590
To act like we ain't got no goddamn sense?

2520
02:13:34,632 --> 02:13:36,091
We coulda did all this dumb shit

2521
02:13:36,133 --> 02:13:37,468
back in Compton!

2522
02:13:38,135 --> 02:13:40,387
But this what the fuck y'all turned into.

2523
02:13:40,471 --> 02:13:41,972
You sittin' up here eatin' fuckin' crab.

2524
02:13:42,056 --> 02:13:44,058
Who the fuck are you? Huh?

2525
02:13:45,893 --> 02:13:49,313
This my motherfucking name
on the wall, man!

2526
02:13:50,814 --> 02:13:53,984
And y'all in here acting like
y'all on motherfucking vacation.

2527
02:13:54,068 --> 02:13:56,946
I got Pac in the next motherfucking room.

2528
02:13:56,987 --> 02:13:59,240
Grindin', man! Workin'!

2529
02:14:00,115 --> 02:14:02,618
And y'all niggas in here partyin'?

2530
02:14:04,245 --> 02:14:05,829
One time?

2531
02:14:12,378 --> 02:14:13,858
- You trippin'.
- That's right.

2532
02:14:14,547 --> 02:14:16,090
We can do anything we wanna do.

2533
02:14:16,674 --> 02:14:18,717
We started this thing. This is us.

2534
02:14:18,801 --> 02:14:20,844
Nah, nigga. Death Row, that's us.

2535
02:14:22,429 --> 02:14:24,765
I don't know what the fuck this shit is.

2536
02:14:25,766 --> 02:14:27,726
Better watch your mouth, Blood.

2537
02:14:27,810 --> 02:14:29,812
And who the fuck you talking to, huh?

2538
02:14:29,979 --> 02:14:31,313
Nigga, you ain't nothing but a producer.

2539
02:14:31,480 --> 02:14:33,065
Get the fuck out my face!

2540
02:14:42,366 --> 02:14:43,492
Shit!

2541
02:14:44,785 --> 02:14:45,786
Dre.

2542
02:14:47,913 --> 02:14:49,707
This is bullshit.

2543
02:14:49,790 --> 02:14:50,791
Dre!

2544
02:15:07,725 --> 02:15:10,227
Always fucking with me!

2545
02:15:36,212 --> 02:15:37,963
<i>Stop the vehicle now.</i>

2546
02:15:42,259 --> 02:15:44,386
Driver, hold it right there.

2547
02:15:45,054 --> 02:15:47,097
<i>Turn your vehicle off.</i>

2548
02:15:47,139 --> 02:15:49,266
<i>Drop the keys out of the window!</i>

2549
02:15:49,975 --> 02:15:51,018
<i>Open the door.</i>

2550
02:15:53,062 --> 02:15:56,607
<i>Step out of the vehicle. Hands in the air.</i>

2551
02:15:57,566 --> 02:15:59,693
<i>Keep them up! Hold it there.</i>

2552
02:16:01,779 --> 02:16:03,739
<i>Turn around.</i>

2553
02:16:03,781 --> 02:16:06,158
<i>Turn around. Fingers behind your head.</i>

2554
02:16:06,367 --> 02:16:07,607
Hold it right there.

2555
02:16:17,169 --> 02:16:18,420
Hey, that's Eazy.

2556
02:16:20,631 --> 02:16:23,300
Wazzup, E! I didn't know that was you.

2557
02:16:24,593 --> 02:16:26,833
- Hey, wassup? Wassup, homie?
- Hey. Yo, wuddup?

2558
02:16:29,348 --> 02:16:30,474
Nah. Hold up.

2559
02:16:30,558 --> 02:16:33,143
Hey, hey. Hold up. Relax, homie.
We in a club.

2560
02:16:34,311 --> 02:16:36,272
Cube, I just heard you was over here.

2561
02:16:47,032 --> 02:16:49,743
Yeah, I'm here. Whatchu need?

2562
02:16:52,371 --> 02:16:55,499
Everybody to calm the fuck down
from the looks of it.

2563
02:16:56,500 --> 02:16:58,127
I mean, I was just in
the neighborhood, man.

2564
02:16:58,168 --> 02:16:59,503
I came here with Bone Thugs.

2565
02:16:59,545 --> 02:17:01,422
I was just coming to say wassup.

2566
02:17:02,381 --> 02:17:03,382
Wassup?

2567
02:17:04,717 --> 02:17:07,803
I saw <i>Boyz in the Hood.</i> It was good.

2568
02:17:09,263 --> 02:17:11,974
You ain't called that shit
a after school special?

2569
02:17:14,727 --> 02:17:18,188
I like after school specials, Cube.
You know that.

2570
02:17:25,779 --> 02:17:27,364
What's up, man?

2571
02:17:27,448 --> 02:17:29,658
How you feel? You good?

2572
02:17:29,700 --> 02:17:31,535
Hell yeah, nigga, I'm good.

2573
02:17:31,577 --> 02:17:33,329
It's good to see you.

2574
02:17:33,370 --> 02:17:34,872
It's good to see you right now.

2575
02:17:34,955 --> 02:17:36,707
Look at you!

2576
02:17:36,749 --> 02:17:38,209
Pull your fuckin' homies off me then

2577
02:17:38,250 --> 02:17:39,376
if it's good to see me.

2578
02:17:39,418 --> 02:17:41,003
You had niggas jump us.

2579
02:17:41,170 --> 02:17:42,338
God damn!

2580
02:17:43,797 --> 02:17:45,637
How you go from selling rocks
in the dope house

2581
02:17:45,716 --> 02:17:48,886
to having dinner
in the White House with the President?

2582
02:17:48,928 --> 02:17:52,348
They still trying to figure that shit out.

2583
02:17:52,389 --> 02:17:54,892
But, hey, all publicity...

2584
02:17:54,934 --> 02:17:56,560
...is good publicity.

2585
02:17:56,644 --> 02:17:58,020
You know it.

2586
02:17:58,062 --> 02:17:59,146
You know that's right.

2587
02:17:59,230 --> 02:18:00,522
Man.

2588
02:18:01,065 --> 02:18:04,109
Look, man, I wish that dumb shit

2589
02:18:04,193 --> 02:18:05,913
really would've never
popped off between us.

2590
02:18:05,945 --> 02:18:08,197
We shouldn't have
dissed each other in the first place.

2591
02:18:08,239 --> 02:18:10,366
Making the fans choose between us?

2592
02:18:10,407 --> 02:18:11,575
That wasn't cool.

2593
02:18:12,535 --> 02:18:13,661
You right.

2594
02:18:16,080 --> 02:18:17,915
You ever think we'd be that big, though?

2595
02:18:17,998 --> 02:18:19,250
Hell, no.

2596
02:18:19,333 --> 02:18:21,210
I was just talking to my wife about that.

2597
02:18:21,252 --> 02:18:23,087
How it was in the beginning.

2598
02:18:23,128 --> 02:18:25,631
Shit, we just wanted to do music
for the neighborhood.

2599
02:18:25,714 --> 02:18:27,174
Be ghetto stars.

2600
02:18:27,883 --> 02:18:29,927
But what if we had the chance

2601
02:18:29,969 --> 02:18:33,222
to find out how big we can really be?

2602
02:18:33,264 --> 02:18:35,599
Come on, man. You got my mind workin'.

2603
02:18:35,641 --> 02:18:38,185
I've been thinking
about that shit all the time.

2604
02:18:38,269 --> 02:18:41,188
If we could just take that shit back to '89.
We changed the world!

2605
02:18:41,480 --> 02:18:44,149
I hear you.
It was a simpler time, you know?

2606
02:18:44,233 --> 02:18:45,943
It was hard then.

2607
02:18:46,026 --> 02:18:47,069
But I've had days

2608
02:18:47,111 --> 02:18:49,947
where I almost wish
we was gettin' arrested in Detroit again.

2609
02:18:49,989 --> 02:18:51,615
Shit. You know?

2610
02:18:51,824 --> 02:18:53,450
Shit ain't gotta stop there.

2611
02:18:54,076 --> 02:18:55,661
But if we go do this,

2612
02:18:56,829 --> 02:18:58,539
we gotta do it right.

2613
02:18:58,622 --> 02:19:00,875
And if Dre with it, I'm with it.

2614
02:19:01,125 --> 02:19:03,586
But I don't know your
relationship with dude.

2615
02:19:04,545 --> 02:19:07,464
But if you want me, Eric,
Jerry can't be there.

2616
02:19:12,177 --> 02:19:13,220
All right.

2617
02:19:15,222 --> 02:19:16,223
Hey, man.

2618
02:19:17,600 --> 02:19:18,601
Shit!

2619
02:19:18,893 --> 02:19:20,519
It's 'cause you
ain't got them damn gloves on.

2620
02:19:20,603 --> 02:19:21,812
Man, whatever.

2621
02:19:23,397 --> 02:19:25,107
But I hear you.

2622
02:19:25,566 --> 02:19:26,609
Yeah?

2623
02:19:27,484 --> 02:19:29,820
Shit. Ar'ight.

2624
02:19:31,030 --> 02:19:33,574
These invoices haven't been paid.

2625
02:19:33,657 --> 02:19:36,035
They're two or three years outdated.

2626
02:19:36,118 --> 02:19:38,829
These are cancelled checks.
They all bounced.

2627
02:19:38,913 --> 02:19:41,123
And these are past due.

2628
02:19:41,165 --> 02:19:43,125
Jerry took advantage of you.

2629
02:19:44,793 --> 02:19:46,420
I know it's a lot,

2630
02:19:46,503 --> 02:19:49,215
but you had to know the truth sometime.

2631
02:19:49,298 --> 02:19:50,716
Now you do.

2632
02:19:52,843 --> 02:19:55,512
You know Dre and Cube
tried to warn me about this.

2633
02:19:58,182 --> 02:20:00,684
I've been fuckin' up for a long time.

2634
02:20:05,189 --> 02:20:06,565
Don't. Don't.

2635
02:20:06,649 --> 02:20:08,651
Real long time.

2636
02:20:12,696 --> 02:20:13,864
Shit.

2637
02:20:31,674 --> 02:20:32,883
Hey, man.

2638
02:20:36,887 --> 02:20:40,307
Where you been?
I've been calling you all day.

2639
02:20:42,685 --> 02:20:44,770
Sit down, Jerry.

2640
02:20:48,566 --> 02:20:51,151
What is this all about? The groupie?

2641
02:20:51,735 --> 02:20:53,779
The executive assistant?

2642
02:20:55,239 --> 02:20:57,366
She even go to college?

2643
02:20:57,408 --> 02:21:00,411
Man, you're so much fuckin'
smarter than this.

2644
02:21:00,452 --> 02:21:02,121
Sit down, Jerry.

2645
02:21:23,350 --> 02:21:25,269
This ain't about Tomica, Jerry.

2646
02:21:26,520 --> 02:21:27,855
It's about you.

2647
02:21:27,938 --> 02:21:30,065
And you can stop acting
like you ain't never done nothing wrong.

2648
02:21:30,107 --> 02:21:33,360
You know what, man?
I know that you're upset. I understand.

2649
02:21:35,112 --> 02:21:39,283
But I'm asking you,
I'm advising you, take a breath, okay?

2650
02:21:39,366 --> 02:21:40,951
I'm gonna look at the paperwork, Eric.

2651
02:21:41,035 --> 02:21:44,538
- You can stop giving me advice as of now.
- It's fucked up.

2652
02:21:46,207 --> 02:21:47,458
Here's what's about to happen.

2653
02:21:47,541 --> 02:21:49,543
I'mma get N.W.A back together,

2654
02:21:50,127 --> 02:21:52,463
and you ain't gonna have
nothing to do with it this time.

2655
02:21:54,590 --> 02:21:56,467
How the fuck can you even say
something like that?

2656
02:21:56,550 --> 02:21:59,011
What the fuck is going on with you, man?

2657
02:21:59,845 --> 02:22:01,513
I know what's good for you,

2658
02:22:01,597 --> 02:22:03,515
I know what's good for Ruthless...

2659
02:22:03,599 --> 02:22:07,436
And we have worked up a trust
after years of hard work,

2660
02:22:07,478 --> 02:22:09,271
and that trust is our foundation, Eric.

2661
02:22:09,313 --> 02:22:10,673
I don't give a shit.

2662
02:22:11,315 --> 02:22:12,608
Eric?

2663
02:22:15,444 --> 02:22:18,030
You look lousy, man. Are you okay?

2664
02:22:19,531 --> 02:22:20,699
Trust?

2665
02:22:21,825 --> 02:22:23,786
Trust is a motherfucker.

2666
02:22:25,204 --> 02:22:26,914
Is it?

2667
02:22:26,997 --> 02:22:28,624
Let me ask you something.

2668
02:22:29,625 --> 02:22:32,002
Eric, if what I'm doing is so illegal,

2669
02:22:32,086 --> 02:22:33,286
how come I've never been sued?

2670
02:22:34,296 --> 02:22:35,839
If I'm such a fuckin' thief,

2671
02:22:35,881 --> 02:22:38,008
such a liar, such a motherfucker,

2672
02:22:38,050 --> 02:22:40,302
how come nobody's ever come to collect?

2673
02:22:40,344 --> 02:22:44,139
Because this is business
and this is how it works.

2674
02:22:44,181 --> 02:22:46,517
And it's not always pretty. No.

2675
02:22:46,559 --> 02:22:47,893
Do I cover my own ass?

2676
02:22:47,977 --> 02:22:50,229
Do I cover my own end? Absolutely.

2677
02:22:50,312 --> 02:22:52,356
But don't you dare fuckin' tell me

2678
02:22:52,439 --> 02:22:53,816
that I have not taken care of you.

2679
02:22:54,400 --> 02:22:58,988
Don't you fuckin' tell me
that I have not had your back from day one!

2680
02:22:59,029 --> 02:23:00,698
Day one!

2681
02:23:05,286 --> 02:23:07,121
Is this taking care of me?

2682
02:23:07,997 --> 02:23:09,498
Are you fucking kidding me?

2683
02:23:09,540 --> 02:23:11,260
It's taking care of the
whole fucking thing.

2684
02:23:11,292 --> 02:23:13,002
It's business!

2685
02:23:13,043 --> 02:23:14,420
And this is how it works.

2686
02:23:14,545 --> 02:23:17,840
Have I covered my end?
Do I cover my ass? Absolutely.

2687
02:23:17,882 --> 02:23:19,800
But don't you dare fuckin' tell me

2688
02:23:19,884 --> 02:23:21,760
that I have not taken care of you.

2689
02:23:24,263 --> 02:23:26,098
This business, too?

2690
02:23:26,181 --> 02:23:27,391
Yes! This is business.

2691
02:23:27,474 --> 02:23:29,226
This is how fucked up it can get.

2692
02:23:29,310 --> 02:23:32,521
But I didn't start this.
I didn't fuck it up.

2693
02:23:32,563 --> 02:23:33,856
You did!

2694
02:23:35,691 --> 02:23:36,775
No.

2695
02:23:38,861 --> 02:23:40,112
You did.

2696
02:23:42,031 --> 02:23:43,532
You fired, Jerry.

2697
02:23:43,657 --> 02:23:45,075
Oh, for Christ...

2698
02:23:45,159 --> 02:23:46,911
Eric, this is not how we do things.

2699
02:23:46,952 --> 02:23:48,287
This is not you.

2700
02:23:48,370 --> 02:23:49,747
This is not you.

2701
02:23:49,830 --> 02:23:50,831
Eric!

2702
02:23:52,208 --> 02:23:53,751
This is an important company.

2703
02:23:53,834 --> 02:23:56,086
Eric, I'm not gonna let you fuck this up.

2704
02:23:56,754 --> 02:23:57,796
Eric?

2705
02:23:58,881 --> 02:24:00,007
Oh, for Christ's sake!

2706
02:24:00,090 --> 02:24:01,508
Eric!

2707
02:24:13,270 --> 02:24:14,813
<i>Yeah, hello?</i>

2708
02:24:14,939 --> 02:24:16,690
Wuddup, Dre?

2709
02:24:16,774 --> 02:24:18,651
<i>- Who this?
</i>-Eric.

2710
02:24:18,943 --> 02:24:20,194
E?

2711
02:24:20,444 --> 02:24:21,445
<i>Just felt like calling.</i>

2712
02:24:21,946 --> 02:24:23,781
<i>Yeah. Okay.</i>

2713
02:24:25,282 --> 02:24:26,450
What's up?

2714
02:24:26,492 --> 02:24:28,911
<i>I mean, you know me, man. Doing my thing.</i>

2715
02:24:29,453 --> 02:24:31,288
Killin' all this pussy.

2716
02:24:32,540 --> 02:24:33,624
How about you?

2717
02:24:33,666 --> 02:24:34,917
<i>You know, man.</i>

2718
02:24:34,959 --> 02:24:37,127
I'm just making tracks. Doing my thing.

2719
02:24:37,169 --> 02:24:40,339
Yeah, that Snoop joint you did was crazy.
That was dope.

2720
02:24:40,422 --> 02:24:43,926
Yeah? Thanks, E. Good looking out, man.

2721
02:24:48,973 --> 02:24:50,641
Look, Dre, I know you be busy,

2722
02:24:52,851 --> 02:24:54,144
but I talked to Cube and we were talking

2723
02:24:54,186 --> 02:24:57,356
about some possibilities.

2724
02:24:58,816 --> 02:25:01,193
Possibilities? Okay.

2725
02:25:01,318 --> 02:25:02,319
<i>Yeah, like,</i>

2726
02:25:02,403 --> 02:25:04,989
without Jerry Heller
type of fucking possibilities.

2727
02:25:05,072 --> 02:25:06,073
<i>Really?</i>

2728
02:25:06,699 --> 02:25:07,783
Well, it's about time.

2729
02:25:07,825 --> 02:25:10,828
Man, I mean, I know shit kinda went crazy.

2730
02:25:12,246 --> 02:25:16,959
You know, the money
kinda had everybody divided, man,

2731
02:25:17,501 --> 02:25:19,378
but I really wish it didn't.

2732
02:25:26,135 --> 02:25:29,680
To be honest, man,
I'm not proud of all the shit I did either.

2733
02:25:35,311 --> 02:25:36,437
So, whatchu think, man?

2734
02:25:36,520 --> 02:25:39,356
You think we could get together or what?
Whatchu think?

2735
02:25:43,652 --> 02:25:44,904
Yeah, man.

2736
02:25:46,071 --> 02:25:48,198
Yeah, that sound good.

2737
02:25:49,158 --> 02:25:51,202
Let's do it, E. Let's do it.

2738
02:25:51,493 --> 02:25:54,330
<i>I'mma let you know when we can get back
into the studio, you know?</i>

2739
02:25:54,371 --> 02:25:58,083
Lay down some tracks like the old days.

2740
02:25:59,793 --> 02:26:01,337
Fair enough.

2741
02:26:01,378 --> 02:26:02,379
<i>A'ight.</i>

2742
02:26:03,005 --> 02:26:04,673
It's good to hear from you, man.

2743
02:26:07,092 --> 02:26:08,344
A'ight.

2744
02:26:39,333 --> 02:26:41,710
Man, y'all niggas
ain't making no music in here.

2745
02:26:41,752 --> 02:26:42,920
Hey!

2746
02:26:42,962 --> 02:26:44,088
'Sup, E?

2747
02:26:44,129 --> 02:26:45,589
What up? What up? What up?

2748
02:26:45,631 --> 02:26:48,759
Yo, hey, when are Dre and Cube
gonna roll up in here, man?

2749
02:26:48,801 --> 02:26:50,094
- Yeah, man.
- I'm ready!

2750
02:26:50,135 --> 02:26:51,595
'Cause I'm ready
to get this new shit going.

2751
02:26:51,637 --> 02:26:52,805
I'm ready, too.

2752
02:26:52,888 --> 02:26:54,098
But long as we stay ready,

2753
02:26:54,181 --> 02:26:55,766
we gonna know we go beyond, man.

2754
02:26:55,849 --> 02:26:58,769
You already know
this new N.W.A shit about to be crazy.

2755
02:26:58,811 --> 02:27:00,062
Here ya go, baby.

2756
02:27:00,104 --> 02:27:02,731
E, I got books of new shit.
I got libraries of new shit.

2757
02:27:02,773 --> 02:27:03,899
That's what I'm talking about, Ren.

2758
02:27:03,941 --> 02:27:05,141
That's what I'm talking about.

2759
02:27:06,360 --> 02:27:09,613
I got the tracks. You like that?

2760
02:27:10,864 --> 02:27:14,869
Hell yeah.
'Chu think you Dre now?

2761
02:27:15,160 --> 02:27:16,745
I'm trying to murder Dre.

2762
02:27:16,787 --> 02:27:19,748
I'm about to murder both of y'all
on the track, though. Check me out.

2763
02:27:19,790 --> 02:27:20,958
Check me out.

2764
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:24,003
What you doing, E?
You know you don't play no instruments.

2765
02:27:27,381 --> 02:27:29,216
You gonna play it?

2766
02:27:31,510 --> 02:27:32,803
E, you all right?

2767
02:27:34,013 --> 02:27:35,180
Eric.

2768
02:27:36,473 --> 02:27:37,975
Baby, you good?

2769
02:27:39,268 --> 02:27:42,104
Yeah. I'm all right.

2770
02:27:46,817 --> 02:27:48,944
- Eric! Eric!
- Call 911.

2771
02:27:48,986 --> 02:27:50,529
- Eric! Baby?
- Eric. Get up, man.

2772
02:27:50,613 --> 02:27:53,115
- Get him up.
- Yo, call 911. Call 911.

2773
02:27:53,157 --> 02:27:55,534
- You all right, E?
- Baby? Eric?

2774
02:27:55,701 --> 02:27:57,870
- Eazy, wake up.
- Eric! Baby.

2775
02:27:57,953 --> 02:27:59,163
Open your eyes.

2776
02:27:59,246 --> 02:28:00,686
Yes, we need an ambulance.

2777
02:28:15,679 --> 02:28:18,515
Wait... Ain't you gonna say something?

2778
02:28:19,225 --> 02:28:21,352
What is it? A respiratory infection?

2779
02:28:21,435 --> 02:28:22,561
Pneumonia? What?

2780
02:28:22,645 --> 02:28:25,189
Yes, well, um, it is those things,

2781
02:28:25,231 --> 02:28:26,857
and more, I'm afraid.

2782
02:28:26,899 --> 02:28:29,777
We ran a full blood battery, and, uh...

2783
02:28:31,570 --> 02:28:35,866
I'm sorry, Mr. Wright,
but you've tested positive for HIV.

2784
02:28:37,785 --> 02:28:39,078
Get the fuck outta here.

2785
02:28:39,161 --> 02:28:40,204
What?

2786
02:28:40,287 --> 02:28:41,705
A normal T-cell count

2787
02:28:41,747 --> 02:28:44,208
is anywhere between 500 and 1,500.

2788
02:28:44,250 --> 02:28:46,293
Right now, your T-cell count is 14.

2789
02:28:51,340 --> 02:28:52,841
But I ain't no faggot.

2790
02:28:52,883 --> 02:28:54,051
Mr. Wright, actually,

2791
02:28:54,134 --> 02:28:56,679
the virus can be transmitted
in quite a few ways,

2792
02:28:56,720 --> 02:28:59,848
including unprotected heterosexual sex.

2793
02:29:05,229 --> 02:29:08,774
That's wrong.
You got to test that over. Test that again!

2794
02:29:08,857 --> 02:29:10,276
We've run the test five times

2795
02:29:10,359 --> 02:29:13,070
with five different samples
and the result remains the same.

2796
02:29:13,112 --> 02:29:14,405
- Shit!
- Tomica.

2797
02:29:16,657 --> 02:29:18,117
Tomica.

2798
02:29:18,909 --> 02:29:21,120
But she's pregnant, Doc. What's this mean?

2799
02:29:21,203 --> 02:29:24,373
It doesn't necessarily mean
that she's contracted the virus,

2800
02:29:24,415 --> 02:29:26,917
but we have to test her to be sure.

2801
02:29:27,418 --> 02:29:30,087
What do we do? When we start the treatment?

2802
02:29:30,129 --> 02:29:32,756
I mean, what... I gotta get healthy.

2803
02:29:32,798 --> 02:29:35,050
I got things to do. I got...

2804
02:29:36,677 --> 02:29:38,220
What am I supposed to do?

2805
02:29:38,262 --> 02:29:40,764
Mr. Wright, you need to understand

2806
02:29:41,557 --> 02:29:43,100
that you are very, very sick.

2807
02:29:43,142 --> 02:29:46,437
But I don't even feel that bad, Doc.
Don't tell me that.

2808
02:29:46,520 --> 02:29:48,522
With care and palliative care,

2809
02:29:48,689 --> 02:29:50,357
we can probably keep you comfortable

2810
02:29:50,441 --> 02:29:53,235
for maybe six months, at the very most.

2811
02:29:53,277 --> 02:29:54,612
Comfortable?

2812
02:29:54,695 --> 02:29:57,156
What do you mean, comfortable?

2813
02:30:00,743 --> 02:30:02,411
It's just a matter of time.

2814
02:30:04,622 --> 02:30:08,959
I am truly, truly sorry, Mr. Wright.

2815
02:30:09,627 --> 02:30:13,464
I'll leave you time to process this.

2816
02:30:15,925 --> 02:30:17,760
Doc. Come on, Doc. No.

2817
02:30:18,302 --> 02:30:19,303
Doc.

2818
02:30:31,357 --> 02:30:32,691
Come on!

2819

Shh.

2826
02:30:58,008 --> 02:31:00,177
Just let me make this right.

2827
02:31:00,970 --> 02:31:02,221
Please.

'Cause you healthy, hmm?

2829
02:31:08,394 --> 02:31:11,522
- And the baby healthy.
- Yeah. We're healthy.

- Okay.

- Yeah.

02:40:14,106 --> 02:40:17,151
Dre and Eazy, they had already
been selling it as cassette tapes.

2950
02:40:17,234 --> 02:40:18,319
<i>And they just blew up.</i>

2951
02:40:18,402 --> 02:40:21,238
Eazy and Dr. Dre Wild and Wet Pool Party.

2952
02:40:21,280 --> 02:40:23,073
<i>This is what it's all about!</i>

2953
02:40:23,157 --> 02:40:25,075
<i>We wanted to invite you
to the President's luncheon.</i>

2954
02:40:25,117 --> 02:40:27,703
<i>I said if I go down there,
this'll start some shit.</i>

2955
02:40:29,997 --> 02:40:33,083
<i>When I think of N.W.A,
they weren't really music to me.</i>

2956
02:40:33,167 --> 02:40:35,085
It was more like a real lifestyle.

2957
02:40:35,169 --> 02:40:36,849
<i>Brothers from my neighborhood made it out.</i>

2958
02:40:41,592 --> 02:40:44,178
- You got the dopest album out this year.

2959
02:40:44,261 --> 02:40:45,721
<i>More than happy to get my career</i>

<i>going like I want it to go.</i>

2961
02:40:47,306 --> 02:40:48,349
Damn!

2962
02:40:53,187 --> 02:40:55,439
<i>You do not know
how long I waited to get in his booth</i>

2963
02:40:55,522 --> 02:40:58,025
<i>and to have Dre out there goin',
"You ready?"</i>

2964
02:40:58,108 --> 02:41:00,468
<i>I waited all my life for that,
since</i> Straight Outta Compton.

2965
02:41:01,111 --> 02:41:02,571
Dre's direction was helping me

2966
02:41:02,613 --> 02:41:04,448
become a strong lyricist, which I am now.

2967
02:41:09,787 --> 02:41:10,955
<i>Dre has taught me a lot.</i>

2968
02:41:10,996 --> 02:41:13,249

<i>You'd have to even credit
both Eminem's and my success'</i>

2971
02:41:16,794 --> 02:41:17,878
to Dr. Dre.

2972
02:41:19,880 --> 02:41:21,298
<i>Apple's purchase of Beats</i>

2973
02:41:21,382 --> 02:41:23,676
<i>will be the biggest deal in its history.</i>

2974
02:41:23,759 --> 02:41:25,261
<i>Our music was like our weapon.</i>

2975
02:41:25,302 --> 02:41:26,887
