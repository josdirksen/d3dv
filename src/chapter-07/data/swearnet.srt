1
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:08,500
<i>You clip it, point,</i>

2
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:10,035
<i>you stupid quiff.</i>

00:01:10,037 --> 00:01:11,170
<i>It was straight up,</i>
<i>you fuckhead,</i>

4
00:01:11,172 --> 00:01:13,405
just like my cock
for your slutty mom.

5
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,174
Holy fuck,
it's the trailer park boys!

6
00:01:15,176 --> 00:01:17,342
Are you guys gonna get the show
goin' again this year?

7
00:01:17,344 --> 00:01:19,678
No, actually, we have two brand
new shows we're shootin'.

8
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,513
Well, hopefully.

9
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:23,849
Oh, you fuckin' sharp
little fuckin' slut!

10
00:01:23,851 --> 00:01:26,685
Fuck you!

11
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:28,187
I see anger management's
workin' like a charm, smith.

12
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:29,521
I quit fuckin'
anger management!

13
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:30,856
Actually,
that fuckin' counsellor

14
00:01:30,858 --> 00:01:32,558
was makin' me nuts,
that cocksucker!

15
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,593
Hey, boys, how you doin'?

16
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:36,028
Hey, johnny, how's it goin'?

17
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,229
- Hey, johnny.

18
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:38,697
Hey, johnny,

19
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:40,265
Oh, man, it's great to have
you on the show.

20
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:41,900
The fans are still
so fascinated

21
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:44,536
with "trailer park boys",
you have no idea!

22
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:46,071
We're here to talk
about new shit.

23
00:01:46,073 --> 00:01:47,706
Yeah, right.
They're swoopin' in.

24
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:48,941
They're comin' for you,
bubbles.

25
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:50,542
John...

26
00:01:50,544 --> 00:01:52,111
Hey, do the voice, bubbles,

27
00:01:52,113 --> 00:01:53,779
You're not jim lahey anymore.

28
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:54,913
Yeah, I know,
I'm just fuckin' with you.

29
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:56,715
Come on, boys,

30
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:58,217
we're gonna talk
about all your new shit.

31
00:01:58,219 --> 00:01:59,284
All right, let's just get
this goin', john.

32
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:00,419
Robb and I are gonna
hit the racetrack

33
00:02:00,421 --> 00:02:01,386
first thing in the morning,
okay?

34
00:02:01,388 --> 00:02:03,889
Oh, yeah, right, um...

35
00:02:03,891 --> 00:02:06,258
Look, I read the story
about you and your old man.

36
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,626
Sorry for your loss, jp.

37
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:09,228
Yeah, it fuckin' sucks,
you know.

38
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:10,796
He was trying to hang
on long enough

39
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:13,232
to do one more rally with me,
and he just couldn't make it.

40
00:02:13,234 --> 00:02:15,134
Cancer can go fuck itself, bud.

41
00:02:15,136 --> 00:02:16,902
Oh, uh, hey, robb,

42
00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:18,303
do you mind if I tell everyone

43
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:20,305
that you're workin'
for a cigarette company?

44
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:22,407
The fan's will love
the ricky connection.

45
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:24,243
John, we can't fuckin' talk
about "trailer park boys".

46
00:02:24,245 --> 00:02:26,111
We're not allowed.

47
00:02:26,113 --> 00:02:27,246
No "trail park boys"
shit on the air.

48
00:02:27,248 --> 00:02:28,113
Hey, no problem.

49
00:02:35,089 --> 00:02:37,422
Welcome to "on the rocks"!

50
00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:40,292
I'm your host, john dunsworth.

51
00:02:40,294 --> 00:02:42,828
Today we have some
very special guests

52
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,430
who need no introduction.

53
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:49,434
<i>Mike smith, john paul tremblay,</i>
<i>robb wells!</i>

54
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:52,471
Ricky, julian and bubbles
from the "trailer park boys"!

55
00:02:52,473 --> 00:02:53,672
The fuck are you-?

56
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:55,507
We just fuckin' talked
about this.

57
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,943
I know, I know,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

58
00:02:57,945 --> 00:03:00,145
<i>Listen, I hear you guys are</i>
<i>workin' on some new projects.</i>

59
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:02,614
I hear they're great.

60
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:03,682
Well, that's what we're here
to talk about.

61
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:04,816
We're really excited
to be movin' on,

62
00:03:04,818 --> 00:03:05,951
doin' something different.
It's great.

63
00:03:05,953 --> 00:03:07,452
The big question
on everyone's mind,

64
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:09,955
<i>including mine, is, uh,</i>

65
00:03:09,957 --> 00:03:11,623
<i>do you think we'll ever</i>
<i>do any more episodes</i>

66
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,292
of the "trailer park boys"?

67
00:03:13,294 --> 00:03:15,327
- Holy, fuck.
- Fuck this.

68
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:16,795
Fuck this, john!

69
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:19,298
Hey, hey, mike,
have a sense of humour. Ricky?

70
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,632
We can't do this. We're not
allowed. We said that.

71
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:22,301
Hey, hey, ricky!

72
00:03:22,303 --> 00:03:23,468
- Nice goin', john.
- Yeah.

73
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,536
Fuckin' tree!

74
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,876
<i>Faster, faster, faster!</i>

<i>Oh, come on, son,</i>

76
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:09,081
<i>Yes, faster, faster!</i>

00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:13,385
Oh, yeah, oh, fuck yeah,

78
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:14,720
<i>I think I'm gonna blow</i>
<i>a big load</i>

79
00:04:14,722 --> 00:04:16,855
all over your chest, son!
You're doin' great!

80
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:19,024
Robb, robb, don't make my dad
jerk himself off.

81
00:04:19,026 --> 00:04:21,226
It's disrespectful.

82
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:23,362
Oh my god, it's just a doll,
you fuckin' fruit.

83
00:04:23,364 --> 00:04:24,396
It's not just a doll.

84
00:04:24,398 --> 00:04:27,232
My dad's ashes
are in that thing!

85
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:29,268
What? Yeah.

86
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,369
Why didn't you tell me that,
man,

87
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:32,371
before I started
jerkin' him off?

88
00:04:32,373 --> 00:04:35,707
Oh, I'm gonna tell ya I put my
dad's fuckin' ashes in a doll?

89
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:38,777
Sorry, mr. Tremblay,
you were an incredible racer.

90
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,712
I didn't mean to jack
your beautiful cock.

91
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:42,781
- That's enough!
- Punch it!

92
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:55,961
- Go, robb, go! Go!
- Oh yeah!

93
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:10,242
Are these guys ever
gonna grow up?

94
00:05:10,244 --> 00:05:11,843
- Oh, I hope not!
- Go, baby, go!

95
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:15,614
Nice runnin', baby!

96
00:05:15,616 --> 00:05:17,816
You shave off
11 seconds of time!

97
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,818
- Fuckin' women!

98
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:24,589
Oh my god,

99
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:26,872
<i>Daddy's gonna kick some ass</i>

100
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:28,927

Thanks for lettin' me do this,

102
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:40,972
Oh, are you sure you have

103
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:43,308
'cause I want this

106
00:05:48,282 --> 00:05:50,115

Okay, okay, okay,

108
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:56,021
I need you to run some errands.

109
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:57,956
You can pick up that paint
I ordered on your way home.

110
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,624
- Sure.
- Gotta go, bud.

111
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:01,526

113
00:06:05,466 --> 00:06:08,133
Sorry, I love you too.

114

- Give me those lips.
- Oh, the paint!

115
00:06:10,471 --> 00:06:12,137
Dad's in the car, okay?

116
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:14,473
Oh, don't worry!
I'll take care of him!

117

Fuck, I love you!

118
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,709
Oh, it's so exciting!

119
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:21,813
The three boys on the tv again!
Oh my goodness!

120
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:23,215
I just wish mike
wasn't involved.

121
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:24,850
He's such a fuckin' idiot.

122
00:06:24,852 --> 00:06:26,051
What do you mean?

123
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:27,886
They're on the same team,
julie!

124
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,392
Didn't she just paint
the entire fuckin' house

125
00:06:33,394 --> 00:06:35,560
like a month ago?

126
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,329
Yup, she's bored with
the colours, man.

127
00:06:37,331 --> 00:06:38,563
You know what women are like.

128
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:40,499
No, man, that's insane.

129
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:41,500
It was only 1200 bucks.

130
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:43,435
1200 bucks?! Jesus christ, man!

131
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:48,407
<i>You're making that much money</i>
<i>selling half-sized cigarettes?</i>

<i>Fuck!</i>

133
00:06:51,412 --> 00:06:54,846
Well, it'll keep her distracted
while we're racin' next week.

134
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:56,515
Yeah, thanks for fillin'
in for the old man, bud.

135
00:06:56,517 --> 00:06:58,884
Fuck, man, of course.

00:06:58,886 --> 00:07:02,687
Sorry again for making
your dad jack himself off

137
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:05,023
and say he was gonna blow loads
all over your tits.

138
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:06,691
I didn't know it was
actually him inside.

139
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:08,727
Ah, it's cool, man.

140
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:10,262
Yeah, you should have.

141
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:14,766
Oh my fuck!

142
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:17,068
Is that smith gettin' loaded
into an ambulance?!

143
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:20,205
- Nope, that's conforti.

144
00:07:20,207 --> 00:07:22,040
<i>I told you that was too much</i>
<i>you stupid fuck splint!</i>

145

146
00:07:24,445 --> 00:07:27,045
You can't fuckin' fly!

147
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:28,613
Call me later when
you come down.

148
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:32,784
It's gonna be a fuckin'
crazy one tonight, man.

149
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:35,554
What's up you pussy whipped
shitblasters? Ah!

150
00:07:35,556 --> 00:07:38,056
Jesus christ, smith,

151
00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:40,058
Party got a little outta hand,
nothin' major, baby.

152
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:44,396
Did you forget about this
morning there, moose clit?

153
00:07:44,398 --> 00:07:47,299
I'm fuckin' 100 percent, boys,
ready to fuckin' rock.

154
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:49,401
I thought you said you weren't
gonna have a crazy night.

155
00:07:49,403 --> 00:07:50,902
It wasn't that crazy
of a fuckin' night, man.

156
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:52,737
<i>Mike! Mike!</i>

157
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:53,805
We can't get the whiskey bottle
out of patrick's ass

158
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,574
and he's freakin' out!

159
00:07:55,576 --> 00:07:57,809
It's right up in his ass!

160
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,077
It's really fuckin' up there.

161
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:01,079
We should really call
an ambulance.

162
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:02,747
No, we're not callin' any more
fuckin' ambulances!

163
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:04,483
Jesus christ!

164
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:05,817
Pat drove the fucking
thing up there,

165
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:09,254
he can get it out himself!
I'm sorry.

166
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:12,657
<i>No more ambulances,</i>
<i>my little tits out cookoo bird.</i>

167
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,659
Ah, right on, robbie boy!

168
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,127
<i>Fuck off, smith.</i>

169
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:17,262
Half the length,
twice the flavour,

170
00:08:17,264 --> 00:08:18,930
just like your cock.

171
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:20,599
<i>Would you get</i>
<i>in the fuckin' van?</i>

172
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:23,268
We're late! Come on!

173
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,030
You've got serious,
serious fuckin' problems.

174
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,174
- Keep this party goin'!

175
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:32,110
Boys, I fucked every
one of them.

176
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:34,513
What are you up to now, smith,
30 nights in a row?

177
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:37,449
No fuckin' idea, bud.

178
00:08:37,451 --> 00:08:40,118
So pat's driving liquor bottles
up his ass again, is he?

179
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:44,189
Yeah, except he's upgraded
to 40-ouncers now.

180
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:46,191
Man, you can't be crashin'
at pat's house forever.

181
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:48,460
One of you guys
is gonna fuckin' die.

182
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:50,782
I don't have the money to afford
a fuckin' place, fucktits,

183
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:53,865
liquor's expensive, man.

184
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:54,699
I thought you were gonna
chill out for a bit?

185
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,968
<i>I have!</i>

186
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:00,539
Fuck, I was celebratin',
ya locked up god damn nerds,

187
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:01,873
you should try it sometime.

188
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:02,875
<i>No, you should try taking</i>

189
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,476
"goin' to fuckin' meet
the network

190
00:09:04,478 --> 00:09:07,379
to find out what our fate is"
serious sometime.

191
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:08,813
And just so you know,
there's no guarantee

192
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:10,855
they're gonna green light
this shit, you drunk fuck!

193
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:16,521
Are you fuckin' kidding me?
We're fuckin' icons, boys.

194
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:19,157
We did all their notes.
We kissed their fuckin' asses!

195
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:20,692
You're fucked.

196
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:22,227
Well, you better try
to sober up

197
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:24,896
and get your fuckin' head
in the game for this meeting!

198
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:31,536
Okay, just so we're fuckin'
clear here,

199
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:33,872
I know what's on the line,
boys.

200
00:09:33,874 --> 00:09:36,074
I'm fuckin' taking this
very seriously.

201
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,844
All right, man.

202
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:46,017
<i>Hi, there, my name's david.</i>
<i>I don't wear pants</i>

203
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,386
and I was thinkin' since
my cock's already out

204
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:49,888
maybe you'd like to take
and little suck off?

205
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:52,190
Jesus christ, smith!

206
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:54,025
Your fuckin' breath smells
like drunk shamu

207
00:09:54,027 --> 00:09:56,595
just dumped a big whale load
in your mouth, man, fuck!

208
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:58,697
Come on,
it's just a little tiny penis.

209
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:00,265
Why don't you finger
my little tight hole.

210
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:01,900
Get your fuckin' hands off me,
smith!

211
00:10:01,902 --> 00:10:03,868
Finger my little hole!

212
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,236
Tongue my hole!

213
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:06,371
Smith, would you smarten
the fuck up

214
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:07,872
and get serious here, man?

215
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:09,774
- Expensive statue!
- Guys, marble.

216
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:13,411
<i>Great to see you guys!</i>

217
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:15,046
How you doin'?

218
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:16,114
- It's great to see you too.
- How was the flight?

219
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,916
- It was wonderful!
- Good.

220
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:21,786
<i>Yeah, first class, easy peesy,</i>
<i>lemon squeezy...</i>

221
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:24,055
<i>Good, stephan.</i>

222
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:27,726
That's great, thank you.

223
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:30,395
So, guys,

224
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:32,631
this is quite a selection
you've got here for us today.

225
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:38,236
"Trans-am handyman"

226
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:40,158
and "cooking 'n working out
with mama kunt". Wow.

227
00:10:45,612 --> 00:10:47,746
We've got full seasons
mapped out for both of 'em.

228
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:49,748
We can start shooting
whenever you guys want.

229
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,982
Straight up, guys,

230
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,784
we can't do a show
on our network

231
00:10:52,786 --> 00:10:53,618
with the word "cunt"
in the title.

232
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,620
Sorry.

233
00:10:55,622 --> 00:10:59,090
No it's cunt-
it's cunt with a "k".

234
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:01,926
It's still the word cunt
though, mike, isn't it?

235
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:03,995
It could be a funny concept.

236
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:07,766
What if we called her uh...
"Mama krazy"?

237
00:11:07,768 --> 00:11:10,335
Or how about "mama kooky"?

238
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:12,170
'Cause her name is mama kunt.

239
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:15,273
Not on our network it's not.

240
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:17,976
Okay, well your network
is one letter away

241
00:11:17,978 --> 00:11:19,778
from being cunt anyway,

242
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,613
so what the fuck's
the difference?

243
00:11:21,615 --> 00:11:23,815
That one letter makes
a big difference, mike.

244
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:25,450
It's just the kind of word

245
00:11:25,452 --> 00:11:27,652
that makes a lot of people
uncomfortable.

246
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:29,788
It does.

247
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,656
Have you ever been
to australia or ireland?

248
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:33,458
They call sandwiches
cunts over there.

249
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,959
They do.

250
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:36,695
Like we said before, guys,

251
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:39,030
if you're willing to do

252
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,666
another toned down version
of "trailer park boys",

253
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:43,802
then our network
will certainly listen.

254
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:46,004
- We can't!
- We told you that.

255
00:11:46,006 --> 00:11:48,473
The producers own the rights.
They don't wanna do it. Jesus!

256
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:50,141
It's not like it used to be,
guys.

257
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,377
Even if you were willing to do
more "trailer park boys",

258
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,012
the new cnt guidelines

259
00:11:54,014 --> 00:11:55,346
would restrict you
to two 'fucks', two 'cocks',

260
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:57,382
and four 'shits' per episode.

261
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:58,850
<i>Well, why don't we cut back</i>
<i>on the shits maybe,</i>

262
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:00,652
add a couple more fucks,
you know,

263
00:12:00,654 --> 00:12:02,153
and then everybody'll be happy.

264
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:03,822
Uh, it doesn't really
work like that.

265
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:06,725
This isn't the halifax
swap shop.

266
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:09,994
- No, I'm sorry, guys.
- Cnt just isn't comfortable

267
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:11,563
taking that kind of risk
right now.

268
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:13,832
Christ, so it's an unequivocal
"no" then?

269
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:15,834
Yes...

270
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:18,369
It's a no.

271
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:20,338
<i>Unless you're willing</i>
<i>to compromise on content.</i>

272
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,840
<i>Well we don't feel like</i>
<i>we should have to.</i>

273
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:22,874
That's the way we talk.

274
00:12:22,876 --> 00:12:24,042
That's the way everybody
fuckin' talks.

275
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:25,076
People swear!

276
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:29,047
No, it's not. Not really, no.
I don't.

277
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:30,014
<i>I just wanna know, seriously,</i>

278
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:32,851
are you both fuckin' retarded?

279
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:34,519
Uh, excuse me?

280
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:36,688
There's no reason to get
angry here, mike.

281
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:38,923
You know what? Fuck you guys!

282
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,859
<i>Fuck you both!</i>
<i>We don't fuckin' need ya!</i>

283
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:43,194
Oh gosh, mike, but you do.

284
00:12:43,196 --> 00:12:45,864
Fuck off, stephan,
you condescending little fuck.

285
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:47,599
I'll slap that fuckin' prison
pussy right off your face!

286
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:49,067
Slap it off?

287
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:49,934
Hey, why don't you
just shave it off

288
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:52,203
with your razor sharp wit?

289
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:53,772
You need to take a fuckin'
big hydraulic suck

290
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:55,440
on my shit pipe, fuck teeth!

291
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:56,875
- Wow.
- Okay, we're done here.

292
00:12:56,877 --> 00:12:59,611
You obviously drunk
or stoned or both.

293
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:01,112
Can someone call
security please?

294
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,948
- Fuck, ooh I'm callin' security!
- Fuck off.

295
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,617
I've got three washed up
one hit wonders

296
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:08,419
who need to leave
the building immediately.

297
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:09,487
Fuck! No!

298
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:15,059
Fuck no!

299
00:13:15,061 --> 00:13:17,128
Oh fuck!

300
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:19,898
<i>Today we're gonna be making</i>
<i>some good old</i>

301
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,766
<i>classic shephards pie.</i>

302
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:23,468
<i>All right,</i>
<i>so lots of ground beef?</i>

303
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,404
<i>Lots of ground beef,</i>
<i>some garlic...</i>

304
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:28,106
<i>Do you mind crushing</i>
<i>the garlic for me?</i>

305
00:13:28,108 --> 00:13:30,241
<i>I'll do the garlic,</i>
<i>that's fine.</i>

306
00:13:30,243 --> 00:13:32,404
<i>Then we're gonna put it into</i>
<i>the pan with some oil...</i>

307
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:37,649
You one hit wonder,
you mackeral!

308
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:39,252
- Will you shut up!
- Shut the up, smith!

309
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:42,153
Shut your mouth!

310
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:45,790
Are you fucking kidding me?!

311
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:47,525
- Ow!
- Ah!

312
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:50,495
Aw!

313
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,967
Fuckin' smith! Shit!

314
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:00,138
Oh, yeah, take the whole thing,
jeremy.

315
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,506
Open wide, boy!

316
00:14:04,945 --> 00:14:06,945
Well, that just pretty much
guaranteed

317
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:08,313
I'll be working at 50's
for the rest of my life.

318
00:14:08,315 --> 00:14:10,448
Thanks, you fuckin' lunatic!

319
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,950
You can't be burnin' bridges
like that, man.

320
00:14:11,952 --> 00:14:14,352
Aw, fuck off.

321
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:18,489
I can't fuckin' deal with
networks doin' that, boys.

322
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:21,693
<i>We don't fuckin' need them!</i>
<i>We can do shit on the internet.</i>

323
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,328
Yeah, that sounds like
a great career, smith.

324
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,463
40-year-old out of work

Nice!

327
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,971
I'm not talkin' about
fuckin' lametube.

328
00:14:32,973 --> 00:14:35,206
I mean,
our own fuckin' network.

329
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,041
Yeah, people'll are gonna
fuckin' pay you

00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,810
to watch you swear and jack
your miniature cock off.

331
00:14:38,812 --> 00:14:40,478
Yeah, they would,

332
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,847
all over your mother's
big sloppy horrible tits.

333
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:45,984
<i>Think about this though, boys.</i>

334
00:14:45,986 --> 00:14:47,719
We've got fuckin' direct access

335

337
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:56,361
that's fifty fuckin' grand
a month!

338
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:58,997
<i>Jesus christ, man,</i>
<i>what if a 100,000 did?</i>

339
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:01,666
That'd six million bucks
a year.

340
00:15:01,668 --> 00:15:02,667
<i>Imagine the shit we could shoot</i>
<i>with that kinda money.</i>

341
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:05,670
Fuck my tits, boys!

342
00:15:05,672 --> 00:15:06,871
I would fuck your tits
for that much money.

343
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:08,673
So would I.

344
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:10,575
<i>God, can you imagine?</i>

345
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:14,345
I'd just be prancin' around
gigglin', ticklin' you guys.

346
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:17,715
This could be fuckin' huge,
boys.

347
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:20,952
Our own fuckin' network doin'
whatever the fuck we want.

348
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:25,223
Swearnet.

349
00:15:25,225 --> 00:15:28,760
Swearnet. I fuckin' like that.
It made my balls tingle.

350
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:30,895
<i>Shut the fuck up,</i>
<i>I'm tryin' to cum!</i>

351
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:33,097
Fuck off.

352
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:34,365
Let's take our fuckin' balls

353
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:35,934
and cradle then
on the tips of our cocks

354
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:38,536
and get this fuckin' thing
lit right now.

355
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:40,371
Let's do this.

356
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:43,074
Smith, wells, tremblay,
your ride's here,

357
00:15:43,076 --> 00:15:45,543
and she is some pissed.

358
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:47,278
Oh, jesus fuckin' christ!

359
00:15:57,222 --> 00:15:59,090
I noticed you picked up
the paint, thanks a lot.

360
00:15:59,092 --> 00:16:00,258
I didn't really have
much of a choice

361
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,659
with you in jail, did I, robb?

362
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:07,765
Those look like really, really
beautiful colours, julie.

363
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:13,304
Fuck, that is a lot of paint!

364
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:14,305
Didn't you just paint
the whole house

365
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,140
like a couple weeks ago, julie?

366
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:18,977
It's gonna look
fuckin' good though,

367
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:21,479
that's the designer shit.

368
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,247
That's like sixty bucks a can,
isn't it?

369
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:25,450
It's the best.

370
00:16:25,452 --> 00:16:27,118
Ah, fuck, I wish I had
unlimited amounts of money

371
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,653
to blow every month
on my hobby.

372
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:30,488
Smith, julie took courses.

373
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,757
She's a professional
interior decorator.

374
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:34,459
<i>Oh, no, I know that,</i>
<i>I just mean, you know,</i>

375
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:36,961
usually professional,
by definition,

376
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:39,263
means that you get paid
to do it, that's all.

377
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:43,101
So, mike, I heard you quit
anger management, did you?

378
00:16:43,103 --> 00:16:46,637
No, actually.
Who told you that?

379
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:47,939
Robb, you should tell julie
about the internet channel

380
00:16:47,941 --> 00:16:50,274
<i>we're startin', bud.</i>

381
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:51,442
<i>We're startin' an internet</i>
<i>channel, julie.</i>

382
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:52,844
<i>Rob's gonna be quittin'</i>
<i>his job,</i>

383
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:53,978
we're gonna be swearin'
our fuckin' heads off

384
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,279
on the internet.

385
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:57,281
Well, that's...
We're just talkin' about it.

386
00:16:57,283 --> 00:16:59,117
<i>How much do you wanna bet</i>

387
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:01,452
<i>that robb won't even be seeing</i>
<i>you after today, michael?</i>

388
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:03,187
I'd go all fuckin' in on that,
julie.

389
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:05,123
Mike, please just stop it!

390
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,524
What? I'm tryin' to make
conversation!

391
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:09,127
We're havin' a nice drive here.

392
00:17:09,129 --> 00:17:11,662
<i>So, julie, are you, uh,</i>

393
00:17:11,664 --> 00:17:14,198
gonna go see the sebastian bach
concert next week?

394
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,134
- Mike, that's enough.
- What?!

395
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:18,836
I'm just sayin' he's a fuckin'
wonderful entertainer.

396
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:23,307
<i>He's got beautiful flaxen</i>
<i>golden hair down his back.</i>

397
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:26,878
<i>Tight pants stretched over</i>
<i>his wank.</i>

398
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,346
Some people might even
go so far as to say

399
00:17:28,348 --> 00:17:30,214
parts of his body
are irresistible.

400
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:31,816
Michael, we all know
exactly why

401
00:17:31,818 --> 00:17:35,853
I'm not going to see sebastian.

402
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:36,821
<i>Yeah, why was that?</i>
<i>I can't remember.</i>

403
00:17:36,823 --> 00:17:38,823
Oh, yeah,

404
00:17:38,825 --> 00:17:40,224
'cause you conveniently
broke up with robb for an hour

405
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:41,659
and thought it was fair game

406
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:43,728
to suck a rock star's
sweaty stage cock

407
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,163
in a piss-drizzled
porta-shitter!

408
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:46,831
Jesus christ!

409
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,666
- Get the fuck outta my car!

410
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,837
You're a fuckin' psycho.

411
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:54,872
Fuck you.

412
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:58,509
- See you later, robb.
- Crazy fuckin' bitch.

413
00:18:01,047 --> 00:18:04,015
Holy fuck he doesn't
deserve that shit!

414
00:18:04,017 --> 00:18:06,050
You're payin'

Fuck off.

417
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:11,589
She almost broke
my fuckin' neck.

418
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:22,567
- Smith, this looks fucked!
- It's rinky-dink, man.

419
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:24,102
Why didn't you grid
the fucking thing off?

420
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:26,370
Why didn't you go
fuck yourself?

421
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:27,372
Man, we need better gear.

422
00:18:27,373 --> 00:18:30,041
No shit.

So for those of you who don't

You might actually
die, die, die!

00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,319
So get the fuck out!
Take a fuckin' trip!

Go to quebec!
Have some poutine.

00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:28,726
No way, smith, not this stuff!

Aw, everything's content, bud.

You are so not at hockey,
you lyin' fuck!

482
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:37,568
You think I don't know
where you are

483
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,070
every second of the day, robb?

484
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:40,504
I watch you like
a fucking hawk!

485
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:42,907
Jules, please just calm down-

486
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:44,709
don't fuckin' tell me...

487
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:46,010
Hi, there, welcome to a brand

488
00:20:46,012 --> 00:20:47,211
"I'm a crazy cunt

489
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:49,046
and my fuckin' eyes
are too close together".

490
00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:51,582
Let's observe this crazy bitch
in her natural habitat.

491
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,517
Why, why, why?!

492
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:55,886
You promised me that
you wouldn't see mike anymore!

493
00:20:55,888 --> 00:20:57,188
- Please, robb!
- I'm sorry.

494
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,689
Can we just talk
about this at home?

495
00:20:58,691 --> 00:21:00,358
No, I don't want to fuckin'
talk about it at home!

496
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,392
I'm wanna talk about this

497
00:21:01,394 --> 00:21:02,834
and we're gonna fuckin'
deal with it!

498
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,563
Is that chicken?!

499
00:21:05,565 --> 00:21:07,031
I didn't eat any.

500
00:21:07,033 --> 00:21:08,599
- Yes, you did.
- I can see it in your beard,

501
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:10,735
and you can't 'cause
you're on a fucking diet!

502
00:21:10,737 --> 00:21:12,436
- He's a grown man, julie.
- No, he's not!

503
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:13,271
Get it the fuckin' truck

504
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:16,073
before I break your dick!

505
00:21:16,075 --> 00:21:18,109
Get in the passenger seat
I'm driving!

506
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:20,111
Wow, crazy as a shit house rat,
folks!

507
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:24,282
Notice how too close her eyes
are together, john.

508
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:26,384
It's just like you want take
'em and go "bink" all fixed.

509
00:21:26,386 --> 00:21:27,785
No comment.

510
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,290
<i>- All fixed.</i>
<i>- No comment.</i>

511
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:34,091
I'm stay out of it, man.

512
00:21:34,093 --> 00:21:36,060
Are her eyes too close
together or not?

513
00:21:36,062 --> 00:21:37,895
I had nothin' to do with this,
julie, I'm sorry.

514
00:21:37,897 --> 00:21:41,098
- You're a fuckin' pussy.
- You are fucked, julie!

515
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,233
<i>Where the fuck'd</i>

00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:54,578
No, no, no, no.

1, 2, 3.

521
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:05,623
Man, I don't know how I'm gonna
pull off this swearnet shit.

522
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:08,959
Julie basically said
it's her or mike.

523
00:22:08,961 --> 00:22:10,594
The fact that she's even
puttin' you in that position

524
00:22:10,596 --> 00:22:12,430
is fucked!

525
00:22:12,432 --> 00:22:13,497
You gotta do this with us, man.

526
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:14,739
We can't break up the team,
bud.

527
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:20,604
Hey, sweetie.

528
00:22:20,606 --> 00:22:23,274
Smith uploaded our fight last
night, robb.

529
00:22:23,276 --> 00:22:26,177
It's a show on your stupid
little fucking network

530
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:27,645
and I'm the fucking star!

531
00:22:27,647 --> 00:22:29,180
Jesus christ!

532
00:22:29,182 --> 00:22:30,848
<i>Oh yeah.</i>

00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:33,517
I'm the crazy cunt who's eyes
are too close together!

534
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,453
- That's crazy.
- I love your eyes.

535
00:22:35,455 --> 00:22:37,955
They whole fucking world
is seeing this shit!

536
00:22:37,957 --> 00:22:39,690
I'm callin' that asshole

537
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:41,692
Motherfucker!

538
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:42,760
Smith, right?

539
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:53,471
- And you can fuck off.
- Sorry about that.

540
00:22:53,473 --> 00:22:54,672
Sign here.

541
00:22:54,674 --> 00:22:56,307
All right.

542
00:22:56,309 --> 00:22:57,541
And initial here.

543
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,579
Initial here.

544
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:07,218
Mother's maiden name,
uh, yeah, there.

545
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,320
Okay.

546
00:23:09,322 --> 00:23:11,522
And your blood type.

547
00:23:11,524 --> 00:23:13,190
Blood type?

548
00:23:13,192 --> 00:23:14,912
What the fuck do you need
my blood type for?

549
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:21,432
Ab positive.

550
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:24,568
Perfect, all done.

551
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:27,738
That was painless.

552
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,507
So, thanks very much,
mr. Pinchbeck.

553
00:23:29,509 --> 00:23:31,342
Like I said, you know,

554
00:23:31,344 --> 00:23:33,844
I doubt it's gonna take
the whole term to pay you back.

555
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:37,014
Let's look at it like
you pay me as it comes in.

556
00:23:37,016 --> 00:23:39,083
Sounds good.

557
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:44,255
<i>- Smith, you fucking cocksucker!</i>
<i>- What?!</i>

558
00:23:44,257 --> 00:23:45,423
What were you thinkin', man?

559
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:47,591
Mr. Wells, mr. Tremblay.

560
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:50,528
So nice to meet you both.
I'm mr. Pinchbeck.

561
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:52,029
And this is my half-brother
logi.

562
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:55,566
Hey, nice to meet you guys.

563
00:23:55,568 --> 00:23:57,601
You know, there's nothing more
satisfying for me

564
00:23:57,603 --> 00:24:00,871
than investing in people when
they're just starting out

565
00:24:00,873 --> 00:24:03,407
and watching them
become a success.

566
00:24:03,409 --> 00:24:05,910
Oh, I had fantasies

567
00:24:05,912 --> 00:24:09,780
about the entertainment
business years ago,

568
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:12,283
and now I think
I might be in it.

569
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,454
Okay.

570
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:18,756
Any questions at all?

571
00:24:18,758 --> 00:24:21,459
Sure, yeah, we should
definitely stay in touch.

572
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:23,727
And we will.

573
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,066
- Are you fucked?!
- What?!

574
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:30,434
How could you upload that shit,
man?!

575
00:24:30,436 --> 00:24:31,435
You made julie look
like she's nuts!

576
00:24:31,437 --> 00:24:34,238
She is! I'm sorry!

577
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,606
People fuckin'
loved it though, man.

578
00:24:35,608 --> 00:24:37,741
We got a fuckin'
1000 memberships!

579
00:24:37,743 --> 00:24:39,910
What? That's preety good,
isn't it?

580
00:24:39,912 --> 00:24:42,480
Pretty good?
That's 5000 fuckin' bucks!

581
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:44,315
No shit.

582
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:46,417
Mike yeah, no shit.
Boys, I'm tellin' ya

583
00:24:46,419 --> 00:24:48,252
it's time to get on the fuckin
swearnet ship

584
00:24:48,254 --> 00:24:50,955
or row the fuck ashore
in your fuckin' whore dories,

585
00:24:50,957 --> 00:24:52,623
<i>I've been workin' my cunt</i>

587
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,826
and it's gonna be fuckin'
amazing!

588
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:58,128
And now we got the fuckin'
money to do it!

589
00:24:58,130 --> 00:24:59,330
<i>You borrowed money off those</i>
<i>fuckin' loan sharks?</i>

590
00:24:59,332 --> 00:25:01,265
A bit, yeah,

591
00:25:01,267 --> 00:25:03,601
but I mean, fuck,
enough to get equipment

592
00:25:03,603 --> 00:25:06,003
and get start shit
fuckin' properly.

593
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:08,506
<i>This is goin' down</i>
<i>right the fuck now, boys,</i>

594
00:25:08,508 --> 00:25:10,608
<i>with or without you guys.</i>
<i>Are you in or out?</i>

595
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:13,177
What does that mean?
We're a team for fuck sakes!

596
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:15,946
I agree. We are a team,
an unstoppable fuckin' team.

597
00:25:15,948 --> 00:25:18,983
So let's do this as a team,
no distractions.

598
00:25:18,985 --> 00:25:20,618
Did you tell julie
you're fired yet?

599
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,653
Fuck no, are you crazy?

600
00:25:22,655 --> 00:25:23,988
All right,
actually that's perfect.

601
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,689
Tell her you're goin' away
on business for a week.

602
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:26,657
We can't go away
for a week, man,

603
00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:28,792
what about the fuckin' race?

604
00:25:28,794 --> 00:25:30,294
No, shooting the race
is part of the master plan.

605
00:25:30,296 --> 00:25:32,296
<i>Trust me.</i>

606
00:25:32,298 --> 00:25:34,632
So pack your fuckin'
protein bars, your amino acids,

607
00:25:34,634 --> 00:25:36,667
whatever the fuck it is that
makes you look like that,

608
00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:38,502
we're goin' on a little trip.

609
00:25:38,504 --> 00:25:40,704
What if I get caught?

610
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:42,373
Would you fuck off, you pussy!

611
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:04,728
Aw, fuck, boys, look at this.

612
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:05,696
This is one of the best days
of my life.

613
00:26:05,698 --> 00:26:06,664
This is gonna be awesome.

614
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:09,733
Hey, how you doin'?

615
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:11,068
Man, I am not gonna
get away with this!

616
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:13,671
We gotta get checked
the fuck in quick!

617
00:26:13,673 --> 00:26:15,539
Holy fuck, you are fascinating.

618
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:17,575
Smith, juyst turn off
the fucking camera,

619
00:26:17,577 --> 00:26:18,676
and don't think you're gonna

620
00:26:18,678 --> 00:26:20,678
because you're not.

621
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,845
I don't think you guys
get the fuckin' concept

622
00:26:21,847 --> 00:26:23,581
of swearnet here, boys.

623
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:25,182
Everything is fuckin' content.

624
00:26:25,184 --> 00:26:26,016
We're not just shootin'
news, weather and sports.

625
00:26:26,018 --> 00:26:27,685
That's lame as shit.

626
00:26:27,687 --> 00:26:29,520
We need fuckin' drama!

627
00:26:29,522 --> 00:26:31,555
Smith, shut the fuck up!
Listen to me!

628
00:26:31,557 --> 00:26:33,557
Julie could be lurkin' around
any one of these corners!

629
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:34,925
Oh, julie, could be lurking
around anyone of these cor-

630
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:37,027
you candy coated piss gussler.

631
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:38,429
Why the fuck would julie
be in the lobby

632
00:26:38,431 --> 00:26:40,598
of a hotel in downtown
fuckin' halifax?!

633
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,199
<i>That's bullshit!</i>

634
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:44,902
What do you mean you gave
my fuckin' room away?!

635
00:26:44,904 --> 00:26:48,038
That's sebastian fuckin' bach!

636
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,707
Okay, forget what
I said before.

637
00:26:49,709 --> 00:26:53,043
There's a really good chance
julie could be here.

638
00:26:53,045 --> 00:26:54,878
Well, you will find
my reservation right now

639
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,447
or I'm gonna bounce
this bottle of whiskey

640
00:26:56,449 --> 00:26:57,969
right off the side
of your fuckin' lid!

641
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:03,721
Sir, you were supposed
to check-in two days ago.

642
00:27:03,723 --> 00:27:06,557
Hi, there, welcome to "hotel
fuck arounds" here on swearnet.

643
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:09,126
We have a situation unfolding
with sebastian fuckin' bach!

644
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:12,730
I was riding a ferry
across the tranquil waters

645
00:27:12,732 --> 00:27:14,093
of the bay of fuckin' fundy,
dummy!

646
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:17,768
Excuse me, sebastian bach?

647
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:19,236
Swearnet's
"hotel fuck arounds".

648
00:27:19,238 --> 00:27:21,271
Can you tell us
the situation unfolding?

649
00:27:21,273 --> 00:27:23,607
Yes, I can tell you
the fuckin' situation!

650
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:25,242
I rented a room in this dump

651
00:27:25,244 --> 00:27:28,245
and this clown ass dink
has given it away

652
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:29,913
because I'm just late
like two days?!

653
00:27:29,915 --> 00:27:31,782
Jesus christ!

654
00:27:31,784 --> 00:27:33,585
That sounds like fuckin'
bullshit to me, dude.

655
00:27:33,586 --> 00:27:36,754
Yeah, you know what?
It is a real fuck around.

656
00:27:36,756 --> 00:27:38,489
And as far as this hotel goes?

657
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:44,495
Why don't you all suck my rig!

658
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,499
And cut.

659
00:27:56,107 --> 00:27:58,809
All right, boys,
get ready to butter your tits.

660
00:27:58,811 --> 00:28:01,612
Jesus christ!

661
00:28:01,614 --> 00:28:02,680
Oh man!

662
00:28:02,682 --> 00:28:03,781
This is fuckin' awesome, man!

663
00:28:03,783 --> 00:28:04,948
Check this shit out.

664
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:08,452
This is fuckin' amazing!

665
00:28:08,454 --> 00:28:11,288
You guys ready for surprise

666
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:15,025
Boys, you are now officially
racing for team swearnet.

667
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:17,161

Those are fuckin' badass!

669
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:23,033
I wanna shoot a whole fuckin'
segment called "race dicks".

670
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:23,867
If think if we make
it crazy enough

671
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:26,336
it will be fuckin' huge.

672
00:28:26,338 --> 00:28:28,806
- These suits are gorgeous!
- You got one for me?

673
00:28:28,808 --> 00:28:30,374
Oh, buddy,

674
00:28:30,376 --> 00:28:32,309
you've got the fuckin'
coolist suit of us all.

675
00:28:32,311 --> 00:28:33,711
Huh, you're "swearman" now,

676
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,647
Right on.

677
00:28:36,649 --> 00:28:38,015
What the fuck is this?!

678
00:28:38,017 --> 00:28:40,217
I can't wear this!
I can't wear silk, man!

679
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:41,739
Pat, swearman is gonna
be fuckin' huge.

680
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,989
You're gonna be world famous
you squishy fuck tanker.

681
00:28:45,991 --> 00:28:47,858
Girl's boots?

682
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,159
They're not girl's boots.

683
00:28:49,161 --> 00:28:50,661
Lots of guys wear boots.

684
00:28:50,663 --> 00:28:52,663
Surprise number two, boys.

685

Press passes.

686
00:28:54,533 --> 00:28:57,234
Canada versus the united states
world junior final

687
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:59,169
at the halifax fuckin'
metro centre.

688
00:28:59,171 --> 00:29:01,338
I got us a fuckin' skybox,
boys!

689
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,006
Fuck my piss hole

690
00:29:03,008 --> 00:29:05,375
Are you serious?! Yes!

691
00:29:05,377 --> 00:29:08,545
Serious as a galvanized whore
at a tin shop.

692
00:29:08,547 --> 00:29:11,682
Swearman, down the fuckin'
hatch you hunk of fuck meat.

693
00:29:11,684 --> 00:29:12,850
Time to get suited up, bud.

694
00:29:12,852 --> 00:29:15,686
I'm not fuckin' drinkin'.

695
00:29:15,688 --> 00:29:16,887
Pat, you put the fuckin'
suit on

696
00:29:16,889 --> 00:29:18,689
and you start guzzling liquor

to do with swearnet.

698
00:29:20,192 --> 00:29:21,558
Mike, I don't want to be known

699
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,927
as the fuckin' drunk guy
on the internet.

700
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:27,097
Your fuckin' face is gonna
be covered in a fuckin' mask!

701
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:29,199
Nobody's gonna know
who you are.

702
00:29:29,201 --> 00:29:31,869
Come on, man,
swearnet needs a mascot

703
00:29:31,871 --> 00:29:33,737
and it's you, buddy.
You gotta do it.

704

00:33:06,118 --> 00:33:07,084
It's just been brought
to my attention

777
00:33:07,086 --> 00:33:08,452
that our mascot swearman,

778
00:33:08,454 --> 00:33:10,620
has a 3 and a half inch
fully erect penis,

779
00:33:10,622 --> 00:33:12,089
which I find a little strange

780
00:33:12,091 --> 00:33:13,090
considering there's
only men in the room,

781
00:33:13,092 --> 00:33:14,091
don't you think, john paul?

782
00:33:14,093 --> 00:33:16,093
It's quite strange, robb.

783
00:33:16,095 --> 00:33:17,294
Swearman, can you tell
us why your tiny, tiny cock

784
00:33:17,296 --> 00:33:19,096
is hard right now?

785
00:33:19,098 --> 00:33:20,430
I'll tell you why
it's fuckin' hard!

786
00:33:20,432 --> 00:33:22,099
'Cause I'm wearing
a skintight silky suit

787
00:33:22,101 --> 00:33:23,133
and it's rubbin' my cock!

788
00:33:24,603 --> 00:33:25,669
<i>Sorry I've got a hard cock</i>

789
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:27,304
'cause silky things
are rubbin' on it!

790
00:33:27,306 --> 00:33:29,940
I'm not all manly like you,
john paul,

791
00:33:29,942 --> 00:33:32,642
when silky rubs my knob
I fucking gets hard!

792
00:33:32,644 --> 00:33:35,145
And if you haven't had
a silky rub nob

793
00:33:35,147 --> 00:33:38,949
it feels fucking fantastic!

794
00:33:38,951 --> 00:33:40,784
Guys, what the fuck
is going on in here?!

795
00:33:40,786 --> 00:33:41,618
Shut that thing down!

796
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,153
Fuck off!

797
00:33:43,155 --> 00:33:44,187
Take him high, ronnie,
he's hard as a rock!

798
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:45,956
We have fuckin' passes, guys!

799
00:33:45,958 --> 00:33:47,591
Fuck off! What the-ah!

800
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:50,293
Ah!

801
00:33:51,163 --> 00:33:53,463
Hold on, pat!

802
00:33:53,465 --> 00:33:56,133
- What the fuck?!
- Get me the fuck down!

803
00:33:56,135 --> 00:34:00,037
Fuck you, cnt, you cocksuckers!

804
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:02,806
Ah! Ah! Ah!

805
00:34:02,808 --> 00:34:05,175
You should probably shoot that.

806
00:34:05,177 --> 00:34:06,476
You're on the big screen, bud!

807
00:34:06,478 --> 00:34:09,212
Holy fuck, this is fucked!

808
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:14,651
What the fuck?!

809
00:34:14,653 --> 00:34:16,520
Get me the fuck down!

810
00:34:16,522 --> 00:34:18,522
I fuckin' swear, cocksuckers!

811
00:34:18,524 --> 00:34:19,689
<i>An incredibly harrowing</i>

812
00:34:19,691 --> 00:34:22,192
and potentially deadly
situation at game 7

813
00:34:22,194 --> 00:34:23,994
of the canada-u. S.
Series tonight

814
00:34:23,996 --> 00:34:25,529
when patrick roach,

815
00:34:25,531 --> 00:34:27,030
who you may know better
as the shirtless,

816
00:34:27,032 --> 00:34:29,066
homosexual trailer park
resident, randy,

817
00:34:29,068 --> 00:34:31,234
from "trailer park boys",

818
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:34,204
hung from a skybox
naked from the waist down.

819
00:34:34,206 --> 00:34:36,039
It really was a dumb stunt,
bill.

820
00:34:36,041 --> 00:34:38,341
I don't know who swearman is,

821
00:34:38,343 --> 00:34:41,178
but clearly a publicity
stunt of some sort.

822
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,379
And not a good one either.

823
00:34:42,381 --> 00:34:44,181
I know if my penis
was that tiny

824
00:34:44,183 --> 00:34:46,183
I wouldn't want
the whole world to see it.

825
00:34:46,185 --> 00:34:49,719
And not sure it was
semi-erect either.

826
00:34:49,721 --> 00:34:51,254
Well, mr. Roach was
subsequently arrested

827
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:53,023
by halifax police.

828
00:34:53,926 --> 00:34:55,358
Yeah, swearman!

829
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,260
<i>Swearman, yeah!</i>

830
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:59,396
This is gonna be fuckin' huge,
man.

831
00:34:59,398 --> 00:35:01,199
I think we should be more
like a real network.

832
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,867
Do we really need
cocks on there?

833
00:35:03,869 --> 00:35:06,736
- Yes, we want cocks on there.
- Cocks are fuckin' funny.

834
00:35:06,738 --> 00:35:08,438
People's cocks coming
out unexpectedly,

835
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,373
that's spectacle.
That's what people wanna see.

836
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:11,708
That's what you wanna see, man,

837
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,710
because you're obsessed
with cocks!

838
00:35:13,712 --> 00:35:15,545
Fuck off.

839
00:35:15,547 --> 00:35:17,380
Your grandmother's
obsessed with cocks.

840
00:35:17,382 --> 00:35:18,715
Your grandmother has a cock.

841
00:35:21,253 --> 00:35:24,221
Who was that? Nothin'.

842
00:35:24,223 --> 00:35:26,256
Ole robbie bobbie rackin' up
a couple sunshine girls.

843
00:35:26,258 --> 00:35:27,757
They're hoping to get
a picture taken with us.

844
00:35:27,759 --> 00:35:29,593
You're fuckin' right they can!

845
00:35:29,595 --> 00:35:31,628
<i>Here, girls,</i>
<i>say hi to swearnet.</i>

846
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:34,297
- Hi, swearnet!
- I'm so excited to meet you!

847
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:36,066
<i>I'm excited to fuckin'</i>
<i>meet you too.</i>

848
00:35:36,068 --> 00:35:38,735
Hi, guys, jamie freeson.

849
00:35:38,737 --> 00:35:40,070
I'm sorry, but you can't have
the girls on camera

850
00:35:40,072 --> 00:35:41,905
without a contract.

851
00:35:41,907 --> 00:35:43,640
Well they came up and asked
us for a picture.

852
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:45,242
- I understand...

853
00:35:45,244 --> 00:35:47,244
And I know who you guys are,

854
00:35:47,246 --> 00:35:49,246
but "the sun"
is a client of mine

855
00:35:49,248 --> 00:35:51,248
and they pay the bills,
so, you know.

856
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:53,750
Yeah, sorry, just,
they were fuckin' smokin'

857
00:35:53,752 --> 00:35:56,253
and we just wanted
to document it for swearnet.

858
00:35:56,255 --> 00:35:58,155
What's swearnet?

859
00:35:58,157 --> 00:35:59,923
Yeah, so it's like a regular
channel you'd see.

860
00:35:59,925 --> 00:36:01,291
You know,
it's got a morning show,

861
00:36:01,293 --> 00:36:03,260
news, weather, sports,
all that shit,

862
00:36:03,262 --> 00:36:05,095
except everybody
on every channel

863
00:36:05,097 --> 00:36:07,097
is allowed to swear
their fuckin' head off.

864
00:36:07,099 --> 00:36:09,432
And you honestly got this many
subscriptions just today?

865
00:36:09,434 --> 00:36:11,101
He's serious, yeah.

866
00:36:11,103 --> 00:36:13,170
Swearman's had almost 100,000
views in the last hour.

867
00:36:13,172 --> 00:36:14,971
- Sorry to interrupt, man.
- I'm a fuckin' huge fan.

868
00:36:14,973 --> 00:36:16,273
Do you think we can get
a couple of autographs here?

869
00:36:16,275 --> 00:36:18,141
Sure, man, who's got a pen?

870
00:36:18,143 --> 00:36:19,342
You guys-you guys do cocks?

871
00:36:21,279 --> 00:36:22,846
What?

872
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:24,147
Yeah, we're tryin'
to get 'em tattooed.

873
00:36:24,149 --> 00:36:26,449
Jp fuckin' loves signing cocks.

874
00:36:26,451 --> 00:36:28,285
I'm not fuckin' signing cocks!

875
00:36:28,287 --> 00:36:29,152
Yes we are, yes we are.

Come on, man,
this'll be fuckin' hilarious.

878
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:34,457
It's not gay if you're not
touchin' anything.

879
00:36:34,459 --> 00:36:35,792
- I don't care.
- I'm not signing cocks.

880
00:36:35,794 --> 00:36:37,460
Hi, there,
mike smith for swearnet.

881

<i>That doesn't look gay at all,</i>

Uh, this isn't gonna work.

886
00:36:48,473 --> 00:36:50,640
Oh, sorry,
I got a silver one right here.

887
00:36:50,642 --> 00:36:53,009

00:36:59,218 --> 00:37:00,550
<i>Yeah, swearman!</i>

00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:09,059
Oh, you guys have
a very unique demographic,

893
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:13,163
very marketable.

894
00:37:13,165 --> 00:37:14,998
I would love to talk to you

895
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,500
about maybe using some
of our clients on swearnet

896
00:37:17,502 --> 00:37:19,502
for promotion and advertising.

897
00:37:19,504 --> 00:37:20,670
<i>Cool, right on.</i>

898
00:37:20,672 --> 00:37:22,906
Ah, I don't know.

899
00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:25,175
What about sponsor my car
in the east coast rally?

900
00:37:25,177 --> 00:37:26,343
You guys are in the rally?

901
00:37:26,345 --> 00:37:27,711
I've got some celebs
at that thing!

902
00:37:27,713 --> 00:37:29,913
We've got tom green there.

903
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:31,381
Carrot top will be doing
some endorsement stuff

904
00:37:31,383 --> 00:37:33,016
for liquormen's whisky.

905
00:37:33,018 --> 00:37:35,552
God I fuckin' love those guys!

906
00:37:35,554 --> 00:37:37,420
It's not really what
swearnet's about.

907
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:40,557
Sponsorship always ends up
meaning fucking censorship.

908
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:43,226
Fuck, man, let's not write
it off that fast.

909
00:37:43,228 --> 00:37:45,595
Let me at least see if they
would even be interested.

910

913
00:37:51,536 --> 00:37:53,570
see if we can add
team swearnet?

914
00:37:53,572 --> 00:37:56,606
What do we got planned
for tomorrow?

915
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,908
Nothing as big as interviewing
two huge hollywood celebrities!

916
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:00,877
Let's fuckin' do it then!
Come on!

929
00:38:46,291 --> 00:38:49,592
Not much you can do now, bud,
other than say fuck it.

930

I'm fuckin' dumb.

<i>Here comes swearman.</i>

934
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,270
Here, here,
intro this, intro this.

935
00:39:00,272 --> 00:39:01,971
Today on "drunk tank"

936
00:39:01,973 --> 00:39:04,007
world reknowned
cock-out acrobat, swearman.

937
00:39:04,009 --> 00:39:05,608
Swearman,
how was the drunk tank?

938
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:07,777
Oh, just fucking great,

939
00:39:07,779 --> 00:39:12,449
except at $10,000 fuckin' fine
for public indecency

940
00:39:12,451 --> 00:39:15,352
'cause my erect cock was beemed
around the fuckin' world

941
00:39:15,354 --> 00:39:17,520
to millions of fuckin' people!

942
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:19,823
Okay.

943
00:39:19,825 --> 00:39:22,525
Can you tell us why you chose
not to wear any underwear

944
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:23,526
underneath the suit, swearman?

945
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:25,128
Fuck off, robb!

946
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:27,030
Turn the fucking camera off,
smith!

947
00:39:27,032 --> 00:39:28,832
I'm not in the mood
for this fuckin' shit!

948
00:39:28,834 --> 00:39:32,469
Swearnet is fuckin' payin'
for that fuckin' fine!

949
00:39:32,471 --> 00:39:35,672
Swearnet will do no such thing,
my rotund little fuck beast.

950
00:39:35,674 --> 00:39:37,006
Not a fuckin' chance.

951
00:39:37,008 --> 00:39:38,641
Swearnet is gonna fuckin'
pay for that,

952
00:39:38,643 --> 00:39:40,510
'cause it's your fuckin' fault,
smith!

953
00:39:40,512 --> 00:39:43,146
You're the fuckin' asshole
that made me fucking drink

954
00:39:43,148 --> 00:39:44,481
for fuck sakes!

955
00:39:44,483 --> 00:39:45,682
He's got a point, man.

956
00:39:45,684 --> 00:39:47,150
<i>All right, ass milker,</i>

957
00:39:47,152 --> 00:39:48,518
I'll see your little offer

958
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,053
and I'll raise
the fuckin' thing.

959
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:53,223
Swearnet pays the fine,
swearnet pays you a salary,

960
00:39:53,225 --> 00:39:56,493
but from this point on
you are swearman, bud.

961
00:39:58,662 --> 00:40:01,664
Fuck off.

962
00:40:01,666 --> 00:40:04,000
You wanna test the fuckin'
powers of swearman?!

963
00:40:04,002 --> 00:40:05,535
Well, you better
be fuckin' ready

964
00:40:05,537 --> 00:40:08,371
for what's gonna get
fuckin' unleashed!

965
00:40:12,511 --> 00:40:14,177
I'm gonna drink this whole
fuckin' thing.

966
00:40:14,179 --> 00:40:16,346
Hey. Babe, can I call you back
in a couple minutes?

967
00:40:16,348 --> 00:40:18,882
What? Slow down, baby.

968
00:40:18,884 --> 00:40:21,017
<i>Oh my god, are you okay?</i>

969
00:40:21,019 --> 00:40:22,519
<i>All right, okay, listen,</i>
<i>you gotta settle down.</i>

970
00:40:22,521 --> 00:40:23,720
Everything's gonna
be all right.

971
00:40:23,722 --> 00:40:25,422
I love you, okay?
I'm gonna leave right now.

972
00:40:25,424 --> 00:40:27,056
Fuck, we gotta go!

973
00:40:27,058 --> 00:40:28,358
Where the fuck are we goin',
man?

974
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,426
- Just go, go home.
- We gotta go home.

975
00:40:29,428 --> 00:40:31,094
This fuckin' liquor's good!

976
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:41,204
I can't fuckin' believe
this is happenin'!

977
00:40:41,206 --> 00:40:43,406
Would you get that fucking
camera out of my face?!

978
00:40:43,408 --> 00:40:45,408
Come on, man,
swearnet needs some drama.

979
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:48,044
Fuckin' shit's never as bad
as you think it's gonna be.

980
00:40:48,046 --> 00:40:49,112
God.

981
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:52,449
Holy fuck.

982
00:40:55,886 --> 00:40:57,620
Sweet mother of fuck.

983
00:40:57,622 --> 00:40:59,122
I can't start it!

984
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,626
I try, baby, I try!

985
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:05,762
The car wouldn't start
and then it got too hot

986
00:41:05,764 --> 00:41:07,564
to lift off the blocks!

987
00:41:07,566 --> 00:41:09,299
Everything ignited so fast!

988
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:12,635
I saved your dad though.

989
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:14,571
Oh, thanks, babe.

990
00:41:14,573 --> 00:41:15,605
It's okay, it's okay.

991
00:41:15,607 --> 00:41:17,474
You don't have to cry,
all right?

992
00:41:17,476 --> 00:41:20,577
- Look how ugly I am though.
- I'm sorry, baby!

993
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:22,412
Hey, don't you say that.

994
00:41:22,414 --> 00:41:23,746
You're the most beautiful
woman in the world, okay?

995
00:41:23,748 --> 00:41:26,483
<i>Don't say such silly things!</i>

996
00:41:26,485 --> 00:41:27,617
All right? Okay, I love you.

997
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:33,990
Aw, jesus christ, jape,
I'm sorry, man.

998
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:37,260
I saw two men running
into the woods with gas cans.

999
00:41:37,262 --> 00:41:39,596
I couldn't catch them though
because my hair was on fire!

1000
00:41:39,598 --> 00:41:40,763
What did they look like?

1001
00:41:40,765 --> 00:41:41,965
I don't know, but one of them

1002
00:41:41,967 --> 00:41:43,500
was like a little
teeny black man.

1003
00:41:47,938 --> 00:41:51,107
No, boys,
we don't that's for sure.

1004
00:41:51,109 --> 00:41:52,809
Sure, there's lots of little
teeny black men

1005
00:41:52,811 --> 00:41:54,010
runnin' around, mike.

1006
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:55,478
Well, her fuckin' hair
was on fire.

1007
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:58,348
<i>Maybe she got smoke in her eyes</i>
<i>and got confused.</i>

1008
00:41:58,350 --> 00:41:59,482
Get out of my yard.

1009
00:41:59,484 --> 00:42:00,950
What?

1010
00:42:00,952 --> 00:42:03,520
Get the fuck out of my yard!

1011
00:42:03,522 --> 00:42:05,955
- Now!
- Go, man.

1012
00:42:05,957 --> 00:42:07,056
Jesus, man.

1013
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:11,361
Sorry, brother. Fuck.

1014
00:42:14,465 --> 00:42:16,699
It's okay, baby.

1015
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:17,700
It's just a fuckin' car.

1016
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:22,305
Fuck did he ever get
bent out of shape.

1017
00:42:22,307 --> 00:42:24,641
I don't even know what the fuck
to say to you right now.

1018
00:42:24,643 --> 00:42:25,642
You better call those psychos

1019
00:42:25,644 --> 00:42:27,544
and chill them the fuck out,
man.

1020
00:42:27,546 --> 00:42:28,678
Conforti said they were legit
and they seemed nice.

1021
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:31,481
I'm sorry.

1022
00:42:31,483 --> 00:42:33,383
Holy sweet flying
fuck squirrels!

1023
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:42,091
That's every fucking thing
you own.

1024
00:42:44,828 --> 00:42:47,030
I can't fuckin' believe
julie did this.

1025
00:42:47,032 --> 00:42:50,567
That crazy bitch
ice cream sundae'd ya.

1026
00:42:50,569 --> 00:42:52,702
Aw, man, there's your fuckin'
hockey card collection

1027
00:42:52,704 --> 00:42:53,903
you had since you were five!

1028
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:54,904
Jesus christ!

1029
00:42:57,508 --> 00:43:01,010
- There's your laptop there.
- It's in good shape.

1030
00:43:01,012 --> 00:43:03,746
Why the fuck do you have
a samurai sword?

1031
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:06,049
Oh, is that your gemini?

1032
00:43:06,051 --> 00:43:08,017
This is fuckin' crazy!

1033
00:43:08,019 --> 00:43:09,752
- Oh my fuck!
- Best actor!

1034
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:13,723
Are you seriously filming
this right now?

1035
00:43:13,725 --> 00:43:15,858
Turn that off, man!
This isn't fuckin' funny!

1036
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:17,360
Hi, there,
welcome to this edition

1037
00:43:17,362 --> 00:43:19,562
of "my friends tried to warn
me my hot girlfriend

1038
00:43:19,564 --> 00:43:21,097
is a fuckin' psycho,
but I wouldn't listen."

1039
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:22,699
I'm your host, robb wells.

1040
00:43:22,701 --> 00:43:25,068
Hey, fuck off!

1041
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:28,905
Mr. Wells,
just in the nick of time.

1042
00:43:28,907 --> 00:43:29,739
Are you seriously trying
to burn down

1043
00:43:29,741 --> 00:43:31,240
my fuckin' house right now?

1044
00:43:31,242 --> 00:43:32,241
Well, there would
be little point

1045
00:43:32,243 --> 00:43:34,210
in burning down
mr. Roach's house

1046
00:43:34,212 --> 00:43:37,080
seeing as that's where
the business operates from.

1047
00:43:37,082 --> 00:43:39,582
Your missus is a very
talented artist.

1048
00:43:39,584 --> 00:43:40,950
Is she a professional?

1049
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,088
She is actually.

1050
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:47,590
Mr. Smith, I thought it
was perfectly clear

1051
00:43:47,592 --> 00:43:49,392
in our initial business meeting

1052
00:43:49,394 --> 00:43:53,730
that you have to return calls
in a prompt manner.

1053
00:43:53,732 --> 00:43:55,732
I was shootin' for swearnet,
you know, I was busy.

1054
00:43:55,734 --> 00:43:57,934
I didn't think it was
a fuckin' big deal.

1055
00:43:57,936 --> 00:43:59,769
Oh, mr. Smith,
if I didn't know any better

1056
00:43:59,771 --> 00:44:01,971
I'd say you didn't
read our agreement.

1057
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:04,641
So, do you have a payment
for me today

1058
00:44:04,643 --> 00:44:08,578
or do we have to continue with
these unfortunate tactics?

1059
00:44:10,614 --> 00:44:12,582
Do we have his fuckin' money
or not?

1060
00:44:12,584 --> 00:44:14,250
And why didn't you answer
his fuckin' phone calls?!

1061
00:44:14,252 --> 00:44:15,752
I didn't think he was
gonna start burnin'

1062
00:44:15,754 --> 00:44:17,754
fuckin' structures down!

1063
00:44:17,756 --> 00:44:19,756
<i>Look, we are going to pay you.</i>

1064
00:44:19,758 --> 00:44:22,592
Mr. Pinchbeck,
from now on I'll be dealing

1065
00:44:22,594 --> 00:44:23,826
with the financials, okay?

1066
00:44:23,828 --> 00:44:26,929
And I promise you I will
always answer my phone!

1067
00:44:26,931 --> 00:44:31,668
Well, that sounds satisfactory
enough for me for now.

1068
00:44:41,111 --> 00:44:44,313
And that's just a taste
of course.

1069
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:52,522
Man, who in the fuck did
you get us involved with?

1070
00:44:52,524 --> 00:44:55,291
I have no fuckin' idea, man.

1071
00:44:55,293 --> 00:44:57,460
We gotta get somethin'
on swearnet 24-7

1072
00:44:57,462 --> 00:44:59,529
and pay these
motherfuckers off.

1073
00:45:05,135 --> 00:45:06,669
Wake up you hairy fuck log.

1074
00:45:06,671 --> 00:45:08,638
Here, grab an ankle,

1075
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,339
let's get this mexican fuck
gorilla out on the ground.

1076
00:45:10,341 --> 00:45:11,841
Be careful, he's heavy as fuck!

1077
00:45:11,843 --> 00:45:13,576
One, two, three!

1078
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:18,214
Oh fuck!

1079
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:21,050
Jesus christ, sorry, swearman.

1080
00:45:23,153 --> 00:45:26,522
Anyway, let's drag this beluga
shit walrus inside.

1081
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:29,859
- Ready? On three.
- Yeah.

1082
00:45:29,861 --> 00:45:31,861
One, two, three!

1083
00:45:31,863 --> 00:45:34,731
Holy fuck!

1084
00:45:34,733 --> 00:45:38,334
<i>Holy fuck!</i>

1085
00:45:38,336 --> 00:45:39,869
Jesus christ,
there's a fuckin' secret

1086
00:45:39,871 --> 00:45:42,205
victoria probably
wouldn't care to know.

1087
00:45:42,207 --> 00:45:44,006
<i>It's so wrinkly.</i>

1088
00:45:44,008 --> 00:45:46,342
Did you know he wore that shit?

1089
00:45:46,344 --> 00:45:49,746
Yeah, he made me promise
he wouldn't tell you guys.

1090
00:45:49,748 --> 00:45:51,748
It started back in grade 7.

1091
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:53,850
Anyway, man, I don't know.

1092
00:45:53,852 --> 00:45:55,585
I think you're thinkin' about
this other shit too much.

1093
00:45:55,587 --> 00:45:57,019
I was thinkin' maybe
we should call jamie.

1094
00:45:57,021 --> 00:45:58,421
We gotta tell her we can't make

1095
00:45:58,423 --> 00:46:00,256
the golf tournament anyway,
and let's ask her.

1096
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:01,758
Maybe there's something
she can do.

1097
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,025
Man, corporate sponsorship
goes against

1098
00:46:03,027 --> 00:46:04,861
everything we fucking
believe in.

1099
00:46:08,366 --> 00:46:11,234
I'm sorry, baby,
please come home. I miss you?

1100
00:46:11,236 --> 00:46:13,436
Hmm, oh great,
loonie tunes wants to talk.

1101
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:18,107
- Oh, man, who cares?
- Fuck her!

1102
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:19,876
Well, I should at least listen
to what she has to say.

1103
00:46:19,878 --> 00:46:21,778
We went out for a long time.

1104
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:23,746
Do not fucking get back
together with her!

1105
00:46:23,748 --> 00:46:25,748
I won't.

1106
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:27,884
<i>She's fuckin' nuts, man.</i>
<i>I know that now.</i>

1107
00:46:27,886 --> 00:46:28,951
Anyway, try to think
of something

1108
00:46:28,953 --> 00:46:29,952
we can shoot for fuckin'
swearnet

1109
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:31,721
that's gonna be awesome.

1110
00:46:31,723 --> 00:46:33,890
I'll call you when I'm done.

1111
00:46:33,892 --> 00:46:35,458
You fuckin'
pussy-whipped fucker!

1112
00:46:38,228 --> 00:46:39,729
I'm not gonna get back
together with her!

1113
00:46:39,731 --> 00:46:40,930
You're fuckin' calling
her right now, aren't ya?

1114
00:46:40,932 --> 00:46:42,799
- No I'm not.
- I'm callin' my mom.

1115
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:49,238
<i>Hey, baby, how are ya?</i>

1116
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,640
Cock suckin' fuckin' ants!

1117
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:11,327
Sorry about this, swearman.

1118
00:47:18,936 --> 00:47:22,972
- Loosin' up the wrists.
- Cup the balls.

1119
00:47:22,974 --> 00:47:24,841
- Shut the fuck up! I got it!
- Jesus christ.

1120
00:47:24,843 --> 00:47:25,942
Stroke the shaft.

1121
00:47:25,944 --> 00:47:28,010
God-fuck!

1122
00:47:28,012 --> 00:47:30,179
No more fuckin' autographs!

1123
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:31,614
Don't worry,
you'll get the next one.

1124
00:47:31,616 --> 00:47:33,683
And the next hundred.

1125
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:38,521
Hey, mike, how's it goin'?
Where are you guys?

1126
00:47:38,523 --> 00:47:40,823
Uh, we had a bit of a fuckin'
nightmare.

1127
00:47:40,825 --> 00:47:42,825
Jp's garage caught fire
and burned down

1128
00:47:42,827 --> 00:47:44,961
with his goddamn
race car in it.

1129
00:47:44,963 --> 00:47:46,295
Oh my god, are you serious?

1130
00:47:46,297 --> 00:47:48,030
Look, if I bent the rules

1131
00:47:48,032 --> 00:47:50,533
on swearnet's corporate
sponsorship policy a bit,

1132
00:47:50,535 --> 00:47:51,834
<i>do you think that sponsor</i>
<i>you mentioned</i>

1133
00:47:51,836 --> 00:47:52,969
<i>could help us out</i>
<i>with a race car?</i>

1134
00:47:52,971 --> 00:47:55,838
I think it's very possible.

1135
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:57,139
<i>Uh, let me call you back.</i>

1136
00:47:57,141 --> 00:47:58,708
Okay, thanks, jamie.

1137
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:27,169
Hey, jamie, how'd you make out?

1138
00:48:27,171 --> 00:48:28,571
No fuckin' way! Right on!

1139
00:48:32,676 --> 00:48:35,211
Oh, we'll finally get
to meet those dudes.

1140
00:48:35,213 --> 00:48:36,913
All right, amazing.
You rock, jamie.

1141
00:48:36,915 --> 00:48:38,614
I'll call the boys. Right on.

1142
00:48:41,018 --> 00:48:42,451
Sorry about that.

1143
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:46,422
We're fuckin' in, buddy!

1144
00:48:57,902 --> 00:48:59,902
Fuck!

1145
00:48:59,904 --> 00:49:02,038
Fuck you, smith!

1146
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:05,041
What?

1147
00:49:05,043 --> 00:49:06,876
- Hey, buddy, how's it goin'?
- What're you doin'?

1148
00:49:06,878 --> 00:49:09,779
I'm workin' out and fuckin'!
What do you want?

1149
00:49:09,781 --> 00:49:10,913
Oh, yeah, baby!

1150
00:49:10,915 --> 00:49:13,082
Nice.

1151
00:49:13,084 --> 00:49:15,384
Listen, I just got off
the phone with jamie.

1152
00:49:15,386 --> 00:49:17,553

00:49:19,424 --> 00:49:21,290
What? Are you fuckin'

1155
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:22,558
I'm back in the race.

1156
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,961
- Oh! Oh!

1157
00:49:24,963 --> 00:49:27,096
<i>Fuck! Move that! Yeah!</i>

1161
00:49:38,743 --> 00:49:41,077
It's kind of hard right now,
man.

1162
00:49:41,079 --> 00:49:42,478
Just a second!

1163
00:49:47,918 --> 00:49:49,118
What's with the fuckin'
rose petals?

1164
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:50,653
Just massage me please, robb.

1165
00:49:50,655 --> 00:49:51,821
Sure.

1166
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:55,992
Oh.

1167
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,501
Jesus christ, robb,
who is that?

1168
00:50:07,604 --> 00:50:09,138
It's jp. I can call him back

1169
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:10,506
Sorry, babe.

1170
00:50:10,508 --> 00:50:14,677
No, you can talk to jp.
The mood's ruined now anyways.

1171
00:50:14,679 --> 00:50:16,345
Why don't you fuckin'

1172
00:50:18,782 --> 00:50:21,517
Hey, buddy, how you doin'?

00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,987
Yeah! Oh yeah!

1175
00:50:24,989 --> 00:50:27,523
I'm on too, bud,

1176
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:31,027
Oh, hey, that's really cool
the way you did that.

1177
00:50:31,029 --> 00:50:33,963
Why are you talkin' in fuckin'
pussy mode right now?

1178
00:50:33,965 --> 00:50:36,332
Tell me you're not back with

1180
00:50:38,636 --> 00:50:41,137
Uh, not totally, but yeah.

1181
00:50:41,139 --> 00:50:43,372
Tell him the news, robb.

1182
00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:45,374
What fuckin' news
is she talkin' about?

1183
00:50:47,144 --> 00:50:48,644
Me and julie got pre-engaged,

1184
00:50:48,646 --> 00:50:50,546
she finally accepted
the promise ring.

1185
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:52,715
Congrats, man,
third time's the charm, bud!

1186
00:50:52,717 --> 00:50:54,150
Jesus christ!

1187
00:50:54,152 --> 00:50:55,017
I just got off the phone
with jamie.

1188
00:50:55,019 --> 00:50:56,185
I got you a new car.

1189
00:50:56,187 --> 00:50:58,154
You guys are fuckin'
racin' again!

1190
00:50:58,156 --> 00:51:00,656
Oh, that's really cool, jp.

1191
00:51:00,658 --> 00:51:02,158
Um, I'll talk to julie
about that right now.

1192
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,160
See you, dude!

1193
00:51:04,162 --> 00:51:05,861
Bye bye, come with me!

1194
00:51:05,863 --> 00:51:07,396
Oh, I love you, baby!

1195
00:51:07,398 --> 00:51:09,198
Fuck this is a good workout!

1196
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,233
- Yeah!

1197
00:51:11,235 --> 00:51:13,903
Holy fuck!

1198
00:51:13,905 --> 00:51:15,404
Oh my god!

1199
00:51:16,339 --> 00:51:18,007
What did he want?

1200
00:51:18,009 --> 00:51:19,208
Looks like we could
be in the race again.

1201
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:20,109
Jp found another car.

1202
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:23,846
Is mike involved?

1203
00:51:23,848 --> 00:51:25,181
I haven't called mike
and mike hasn't called me.

1204
00:51:25,183 --> 00:51:26,582
This isn't about mike, julie.

1205
00:51:26,584 --> 00:51:28,551
It's about jp and his dad.
He's one of my best friends!

1206
00:51:28,553 --> 00:51:30,352
Whatever, robb.

1207
00:51:30,354 --> 00:51:32,354
It's great to see what
your fuckin' priorities are.

1208
00:51:34,191 --> 00:51:35,925
- Fuck.

00:53:03,314 --> 00:53:06,282
I just hope he's up there
lookin' down at us right now.

1243
00:53:06,284 --> 00:53:08,350
Oh, man, you know he is up
there floatin' around in heaven

1244
00:53:08,352 --> 00:53:11,020
jackin' that fuckin'
big rod of his smilin'.

1245
00:53:11,022 --> 00:53:13,455
Okay, so I highlighted
some turns

1246
00:53:13,457 --> 00:53:15,658
where a lot spectators
will be watching.

1247
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:17,359
There's some cameras
in the cars.

1248
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:18,494
If you can do some
sponsor shout-outs there

1249
00:53:18,496 --> 00:53:20,462
it'll be great.

1250
00:53:20,464 --> 00:53:22,298
That way we'll get the fans
in the background,

1251
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:25,301
and they can swear,
it doesn't matter.

1252
00:53:25,303 --> 00:53:27,369
We can't do shout outs
while we're actually racing.

1253
00:53:27,371 --> 00:53:30,139
No, I didn't know you meant
during the race.

1254
00:53:30,141 --> 00:53:31,340
It'll be way too distracting,
not to mention dangerous,

1255
00:53:31,342 --> 00:53:33,309
plus I need him navigating.

1256
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:35,978
Well, robb's not in your car.

1257
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:38,647
Huh? What?

1258
00:53:38,649 --> 00:53:39,815
You didn't tell them about
tom and carrot top

1259
00:53:39,817 --> 00:53:41,850
being involved either, did you?

1260
00:53:41,852 --> 00:53:43,185
I'm sorry, guys.

1261
00:53:43,187 --> 00:53:44,320
I thought mike ran
all this by you.

1262
00:53:44,322 --> 00:53:45,721
Tom and carrot top?

1263
00:53:45,723 --> 00:53:47,723
How the fuck are they involved?

1264
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:50,059
Ah!

1265
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:55,864
Stop the fuckin' car!

1266
00:53:55,866 --> 00:53:58,000
Tell me when fuckin' turn!

1267
00:53:58,002 --> 00:53:59,702
I don't know when
to fuckin' turn!

1268
00:53:59,704 --> 00:54:01,337
- There's a fuckin' turn!

1269
00:54:01,339 --> 00:54:03,372
This is a fuckin' turn!

1270
00:54:03,374 --> 00:54:07,209
<i>That was a fuckin' turn!</i>
<i>Stop fuckin' hitting me!</i>

1271
00:54:07,211 --> 00:54:09,345
They stuck me with
a fuckin' lunatic!

1272
00:54:09,347 --> 00:54:10,846
<i>Stop fuckin' hitting me!</i>

1273
00:54:10,848 --> 00:54:12,248
<i>Let me outta the fuckin' car!</i>

1274
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:14,049
- We're in a race pit!
- I'm not fuckin' stoppin'!

1275
00:54:14,051 --> 00:54:15,851
Fuck!

1276
00:54:15,853 --> 00:54:18,020
It's only a practice day, jape.
It doesn't count.

1277
00:54:18,022 --> 00:54:20,856
It counts to me, smith,
you fuckin' asshole!

1278
00:54:20,858 --> 00:54:22,558
I'm sorry! Fuck, you're better
off with carrot top

1279
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:24,360
than tom though, trust me.

1280
00:54:24,362 --> 00:54:25,728
Fuck off!

1281
00:54:25,730 --> 00:54:28,364
How are you doin', robb?

1282
00:54:28,366 --> 00:54:30,199
I'm in a god damn shit show,
smith.

1283
00:54:30,201 --> 00:54:31,400
Tom stopped the fucking car.

1284
00:54:31,402 --> 00:54:33,435
People are swarming us
like goddamn locusts!

1285
00:54:33,437 --> 00:54:35,237
Sorry, kid, not you.

1286
00:54:35,239 --> 00:54:38,107
I mean you guys aren't swarmin'
us really or anything...

1287
00:54:38,109 --> 00:54:39,041
Jesus christ,
you're in a fuckin' race car

1288
00:54:39,043 --> 00:54:41,110
with tom fuckin' green!

1289
00:54:41,112 --> 00:54:43,445
<i>I'm handing out key chains.</i>

1290
00:54:43,447 --> 00:54:45,447
I'm tom green.
I'm handing out key chains.

1291
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:47,216
Would you like a key chain?

1292
00:54:47,218 --> 00:54:48,917
I'm handing out key chains.

1293
00:54:48,919 --> 00:54:51,287
Tom, get back in the fucking
car now!

1294
00:54:51,289 --> 00:54:52,454
We're supposed
to be racin' here

1295
00:54:52,456 --> 00:54:54,790
not signin' fuckin' autographs!

1296
00:54:54,792 --> 00:54:58,627
I'm handing out key chains.

1297
00:54:58,629 --> 00:54:59,762
I don't know how to fuckin'
read maps!

1298
00:54:59,764 --> 00:55:01,397
Read it!

1299
00:55:01,399 --> 00:55:02,464
It's all in canadian!

1300
00:55:02,466 --> 00:55:03,899
I don't know how to fuckin'
read this!

1301
00:55:03,901 --> 00:55:05,234
What do you mean
it's fuckin' canadian?!

1302
00:55:05,236 --> 00:55:07,269
It doesn't make any difference!
Fuck off!

1303
00:55:07,271 --> 00:55:09,405
Aw, fuck this shit!

1304
00:55:09,407 --> 00:55:10,773
Jape, man, you're supposed
to do a shout out for puma

1305
00:55:10,775 --> 00:55:12,474
that last turn.
Smarten the fuck up!

1306
00:55:12,476 --> 00:55:13,909
I don't give a fuck!

1307
00:55:13,911 --> 00:55:15,351
Do you hear what's
goin' on in here?!

1308
00:55:17,782 --> 00:55:19,148
So when she put the hose clamp
on my sack

1309
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:20,616
and turned on the gas

1310
00:55:20,618 --> 00:55:22,618
there were fuckin' feathers
flyin' everywhere, man.

1311
00:55:26,423 --> 00:55:29,425
So do you still eat
chicken fingers or what?

1312
00:55:29,427 --> 00:55:30,292
Nice, robb.

1313
00:55:30,294 --> 00:55:32,761
Smith!

1314
00:55:32,763 --> 00:55:34,830
Hey, buddy, we're gettin'
swearnet god here, man.

1315
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:36,598
Don't fuckin' buddy me!
I got 9 million ant bites

1316
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:37,966

because of you,

1317
00:55:37,968 --> 00:55:40,302
you fuckin' asshole!

1318
00:55:40,304 --> 00:55:42,471
Holy fuck, man!

1319
00:55:42,473 --> 00:55:44,606
- It's fucked!
- Sorry, buddy.

1320
00:55:44,608 --> 00:55:47,276
- Well funny fuckin' this!
- We just got served!

1321
00:55:47,278 --> 00:55:50,779
You went too fuckin' far, man!
Check that out!

1322
00:55:50,781 --> 00:55:54,450
Pat, fuck off.
Cnt can't sue swearnet.

1323
00:55:54,452 --> 00:55:56,118
Well, apparently they
fuckin' can

1324
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:57,486
and they got a bunch
of civil suits against me,

1325
00:55:57,488 --> 00:55:58,520
against swearman!

1326
00:55:58,522 --> 00:56:00,856
Just relax, okay?

1327
00:56:00,858 --> 00:56:02,658
Nobody can prove
they need counselling

1328
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:04,693
'cause they saw your hard
little nib cock on tv.

1329
00:56:04,695 --> 00:56:06,462
I'm not fuckin' worried
about this shit.

1330
00:56:06,464 --> 00:56:07,963
Yeah, well maybe rob and jp

1331
00:56:07,965 --> 00:56:10,632
will be fuckin' worried
about it!

1332
00:56:10,634 --> 00:56:12,301
You fuckin' listen
to me right now!

1333
00:56:12,303 --> 00:56:13,969
You fuckin' promise me

1334
00:56:13,971 --> 00:56:15,971
you don't say a fuckin' word
about this to those guys!

1335
00:56:15,973 --> 00:56:19,975
Jp doesn't need fuckin'
distractions right now!

1336
00:56:19,977 --> 00:56:22,644
Jesus, smith,
take it fuckin' easy, man.

1337
00:56:22,646 --> 00:56:24,680
Pat, I'm just...

1338
00:56:24,682 --> 00:56:26,682
I'm stressed here, man.

1339
00:56:28,386 --> 00:56:31,887
Don't ever grab me by
the fuckin' face again!

1340
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:33,889
- Fuck! Truce! Truce!

1341
00:56:36,993 --> 00:56:39,862
Oh you fuckin-

1342
00:56:39,864 --> 00:56:42,164
listen, you fuckin' cocksucker!

1343
00:56:42,166 --> 00:56:44,032
You fuckin' concentrate
on drivin' up memberships

1344
00:56:44,034 --> 00:56:45,834
so I can chill pinchbeck
the fuck out,

1345
00:56:45,836 --> 00:56:47,536
or I'll rip your shitty
fucking head

1346
00:56:47,538 --> 00:56:49,071
right off your fuckin' body!

1347
00:56:58,048 --> 00:57:00,582
Okay, my cousin leigh's hosting
karaoke at reggies tonight.

1348
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:02,751
I want to shoot swear-e-oke.

1349
00:57:02,753 --> 00:57:05,521
What the fuck is
swear-e-oke, man?

1350
00:57:05,523 --> 00:57:07,423
Seriously?

1351
00:57:09,692 --> 00:57:11,093
Oh yeah, yeah.

1352
00:57:13,196 --> 00:57:14,530
Okay, listen,
I want swearman to host it.

1353
00:57:14,532 --> 00:57:16,698
It'll be fuckin' amazing.

1354
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:18,200
Go get your suit on,
bring a camera down there,

1355
00:57:18,202 --> 00:57:19,535
get set up,
have a couple drinks,

1356
00:57:19,537 --> 00:57:21,570
just wait for us to get there,
all right?

1357
00:57:21,572 --> 00:57:23,105
All right.

1358
00:57:23,107 --> 00:57:24,873
Thanks, buddy.

1359
00:57:24,875 --> 00:57:27,543
Come here, hug it out,
I love you, bud.

1360
00:57:29,947 --> 00:57:31,914
Don't ever fuckin' knee
me in the nuts again,

1361
00:57:31,916 --> 00:57:34,716
you fuckin' arctic
polar whore blanket!

1362
00:57:34,718 --> 00:57:36,251
<i>Jape, how are you makin' out?</i>

1363
00:57:36,253 --> 00:57:37,886
Is carrot gettin' the hang
of this or what?

1364
00:57:37,888 --> 00:57:39,888
- Shut the fuck up!
- Shut the fuck up!

1365
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:43,292
- No! No! No! No! No!

1366
00:57:43,294 --> 00:57:44,760
- Just take this over there.
- That would be great.

1367
00:57:44,762 --> 00:57:46,562
Ah!

1368
00:57:46,564 --> 00:57:47,563
The race is over!

1369
00:57:47,565 --> 00:57:48,897
Stop the fuckin' car!

1370
00:57:48,899 --> 00:57:51,099
I am parking the fuckin' car!
Shut the fuck up!

1371
00:57:51,101 --> 00:57:55,070
Shut the fuck up!
Get the fuck out of this car!

1372
00:57:55,072 --> 00:57:56,472
You're a fuckin' asshole!

1373
00:57:56,474 --> 00:57:57,773
You're a fuckin' asshole!

1374
00:57:57,775 --> 00:57:59,641
Fuck you. Thank you, god.

1375
00:57:59,643 --> 00:58:02,110
Paul tremblay, mike smith here
for swearnet sports.

1376
00:58:02,112 --> 00:58:03,912
You have the sixth fastest
time of the day so far,

1377
00:58:03,914 --> 00:58:05,647
unofficially.
What the fuck is goin' on?

1378
00:58:05,649 --> 00:58:06,748
How did it go out there?

1379
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:08,317
Not fuckin' good!
You know what?

1380
00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:10,085
We tried to do it the way
the sponsors wanted to

1381
00:58:10,087 --> 00:58:12,321
and everything got fucked up
because that dick

1382
00:58:12,323 --> 00:58:14,957
<i>is the worst fuckin' navigator</i>
<i>in the fuckin' world!</i>

1383
00:58:14,959 --> 00:58:16,592
Fuck off.

1384
00:58:16,594 --> 00:58:17,659
Tom greeen arriving back.

1385
00:58:17,661 --> 00:58:20,262
I'm handing out key chains.

1386
00:58:20,264 --> 00:58:23,098
Key chains.
Anyone want a key chain?

1387
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:25,100
You guys want a key chain?
I'm handin' out key chains.

1388
00:58:25,102 --> 00:58:27,135
Robb wells,
mike smith, swearnet sports.

1389
00:58:27,137 --> 00:58:29,004
<i>How did you it go</i>
<i>out there today?</i>

1390
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:30,672
Well, it was fuckin' amazing.
We were so fast!

1391
00:58:30,674 --> 00:58:32,274
Glad I wasted two weeks

1392
00:58:32,276 --> 00:58:34,109
preparing my fuckin' route book
for nothin'!

1393
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:35,010
You're in my fuckin'
car tomorrow!

1394
00:58:35,012 --> 00:58:36,645
- Good!
- Good!

1395
00:58:36,647 --> 00:58:37,980
- Fuck you and you!
- You get in his fuckin' car!

1396
00:58:37,982 --> 00:58:39,147
You want to keep fuckin'
pointing at me?!

1397
00:58:39,149 --> 00:58:40,449
I'm handing out key chains.

1398
00:58:40,451 --> 00:58:41,316
- Keep doin' it!
- You drove me fuckin' nuts!

1399
00:58:41,318 --> 00:58:43,318
I'm handing out key chains.

1400
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:44,653
<i>That's what I've been dealing</i>
<i>with all fuckin' day.</i>

1401
00:58:44,655 --> 00:58:48,657
Yeah, you do not have
to come down here.

1402
00:58:48,659 --> 00:58:50,792
Everything's fine.
Everything is great.

1403
00:58:50,794 --> 00:58:52,361
Um, yes, okay, bye.

1404
00:58:54,631 --> 00:58:56,465
Sorry, listen, this whole thing
with tom and carrot top

1405
00:58:56,467 --> 00:58:58,133
it's fucked. It's not workin'.

1406
00:58:58,135 --> 00:58:59,468
You know the little doll
jp has?

1407
00:58:59,470 --> 00:59:00,869
Yeah?

1408
00:59:00,871 --> 00:59:02,671
He put his dad's ashes
in that thing

1409
00:59:02,673 --> 00:59:04,540
so that they could cross
the finish line together.

1410
00:59:04,542 --> 00:59:07,209
His dad's ashes
are in the doll?

1411
00:59:07,211 --> 00:59:09,478
That is so sad.

1412
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:11,813
Oh, fuck, it's beyond sad.
It's fucking gut-wrenching.

1413
00:59:11,815 --> 00:59:13,382
But that's the story

1414
00:59:13,384 --> 00:59:14,850
I want to be able
to focus on, you know?

1415
00:59:14,852 --> 00:59:17,719
The bond between
jp and his father.

1416
00:59:17,721 --> 00:59:21,023
Yeah, I think so too.

1417
00:59:21,025 --> 00:59:23,992
But you know tom and carrot
don't actually race, right?

1418
00:59:23,994 --> 00:59:26,061
That was just some
promo thing for today.

1419
00:59:26,063 --> 00:59:28,196
Yeah, fuck no, I knew that.

1420
00:59:28,198 --> 00:59:30,032
Give me one second.

1421
00:59:30,034 --> 00:59:34,169
Hey, no those were
happy screams, happy.

1422
00:59:34,171 --> 00:59:35,571
<i>Yes, no, his agent called?</i>

1423
00:59:37,173 --> 00:59:38,874
Fuck, I'm an idiot.

1424
00:59:38,876 --> 00:59:40,742
That's awesome, bud.

1425
00:59:40,744 --> 00:59:42,177
How did you get
her to agree to that?

1426
00:59:42,179 --> 00:59:43,712
I finger blasted her.

1427
00:59:43,714 --> 00:59:45,747
- What?
- No you didn't.

1428
00:59:45,749 --> 00:59:47,416
No, I'm just jokin'.

1429
00:59:47,418 --> 00:59:50,218
I told we'd put more heart
in swearnet.

1430
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:51,853
Yeah, well that's a good idea.

1431
00:59:51,855 --> 00:59:53,188
It's not a fuckin' good idea.

1432
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:55,757
Spectacle's what people
wanna see.

1433
00:59:55,759 --> 00:59:58,060
Get your game balls on, boys,

1434
00:59:58,062 --> 00:59:59,528
we're goin' to reggie's
to shoot.

1435
00:59:59,530 --> 01:00:01,697
I'm goin' to bed.

1436
01:00:01,699 --> 01:00:02,698
No, you're not goin'
to fuckin' bed.

1437
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:05,267
Did you forget about pinchbeck?

1438
01:00:05,269 --> 01:00:07,869
I'll have you's home
by 11:00. Holy fuck!

1439
01:00:07,871 --> 01:00:10,205
I'm not allowed out till 11:00!

1440
01:00:10,207 --> 01:00:13,075
Think about what you just said.

1441
01:00:13,077 --> 01:00:15,577
I'm not allowed out till 11:00.

1442
01:00:15,579 --> 01:00:17,412
Fuck!

1443
01:00:17,414 --> 01:00:18,735
<i>What are you</i>

Come on, boys, this is gonna be
fuckin' awesome!

1448
01:00:36,734 --> 01:00:37,966
My cousin leigh does
karaoke here.

1449
01:00:37,968 --> 01:00:39,735
He's gonna let us do
swear-e-oke.

1450
01:00:39,737 --> 01:00:42,104
What the hell is swear-e-oke?

1451
01:00:42,106 --> 01:00:44,806
You can't fuckin' figure out
what swear-e-oke is?

1452
01:00:44,808 --> 01:00:47,976
<i>Hey, all you cowboys!</i>
<i>Get your fuckin' cocks out!</i>

Oh my god, what is that?!

1454
01:00:50,447 --> 01:00:51,747
I'd say swearman showed up.

1455
01:00:51,749 --> 01:00:53,615

Oh, pretty good, man!

1463
01:01:03,494 --> 01:01:05,427
I don't know, man.

1464
01:01:05,429 --> 01:01:07,129
Fuck, I don't think people
are diggin' it though.

1465
01:01:07,131 --> 01:01:09,164
I just let him go with it.

Yeah, yeah, codeine.

Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, man!

Jesus, be careful

01:03:44,288 --> 01:03:45,120
<i>What? What do you mean careful?</i>
<i>It's codeine.</i>

1528
01:03:45,122 --> 01:03:47,422
It's pure lsd, man!

1529
01:03:47,424 --> 01:03:49,591
You're only supposed to take
a tiny drop!

1530
01:03:49,593 --> 01:03:52,928
What?! What the fuck
are you takin' about lsd?!

1531
01:03:52,930 --> 01:03:54,095
How much did you give him?

1532
01:03:54,097 --> 01:03:55,430
It was in a codeine bottle!

1533
01:03:55,432 --> 01:03:58,300
You gotta sit down
and you gotta relax.

1534
01:03:58,302 --> 01:03:59,768
Man, I'm tellin' you.
We've smoked wheelchair weed

1535
01:03:59,770 --> 01:04:00,936
that's way crazier than acid.

1536
01:04:00,938 --> 01:04:02,938
Okay, that's great, man,

1537
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:04,005
but no one's probably done this
much acid in fuckin' history!

1538
01:04:04,007 --> 01:04:06,007
Oh fuck I have.

What the fuck are you doin'?

1541
01:04:09,313 --> 01:04:10,278
I'm not letting my navigator

1542
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:11,947
trip out on acid
by himself, man.

1543
01:04:11,949 --> 01:04:14,449
We're a team, buddy.

1544
01:04:14,451 --> 01:04:16,685
It's 10 o'clock, we'll be
totally fine by the morning.

1545
01:04:16,687 --> 01:04:18,954
I don't know about that, boys.

1546
01:04:18,956 --> 01:04:20,488
Boy, I can't fuckin' deal
with this right now, I can't!

1547
01:04:20,490 --> 01:04:21,790
No, we're gonna be fine, man.

1548
01:04:21,792 --> 01:04:23,458
- You're gonna be fucked!

1549
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:26,862
- Would you shut the fuck up!
- You just gotta go with it.

1550
01:04:26,864 --> 01:04:28,997
Well, if you're gonna trip,
old boys, all night,

1551
01:04:28,999 --> 01:04:30,732
I'll certainly fucking join ya.

1552
01:04:32,134 --> 01:04:33,368
Ah! Good to go!

1553
01:04:58,662 --> 01:05:02,030
This acid stuff
is fuckin' intense!

1554
01:05:02,032 --> 01:05:03,031
¶ You're on top of the world ¶

1555
01:05:03,033 --> 01:05:05,533
¶ you're on top of the world ¶

1556
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:07,068
¶ and you can't get any higher
you're on top of the world! ¶

1557
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:08,403
I'm flying! I'm fuckin' flying!

1558
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:16,878
¶ It wasn' easy
it was hard as hell! ¶

1559
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:20,515
¶ she never grew up
in a wishing well! ¶

1560
01:05:20,517 --> 01:05:22,017
¶ never hurt so much

1561
01:05:22,019 --> 01:05:23,585
¶ never changed for anything. ¶

1562
01:05:25,688 --> 01:05:27,789
(thank you! Thank you!

1563
01:05:30,693 --> 01:05:32,427
Holy fuck!
How did I even get up here?!

1564
01:05:34,196 --> 01:05:35,764
Holy fuck.

1565
01:05:39,368 --> 01:05:42,037
Hi, man.

1566
01:05:42,039 --> 01:05:44,205
<i>Mr. Wells, mr. Pinchbeck.</i>
<i>Glad you're still up.</i>

1567
01:05:44,207 --> 01:05:45,373
I'd very much like
to make arrangements

1568
01:05:45,375 --> 01:05:46,775
for tomorrow's payment.

1569
01:05:52,715 --> 01:05:55,083
Mr. Wells?

1570
01:05:55,085 --> 01:05:57,118
<i>It's the night people.</i>
<i>The people...</i>

1571
01:05:59,055 --> 01:06:01,056
It's the people of the night.

1572
01:06:01,058 --> 01:06:03,058
Mr. Wells?

1573
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:04,326
I lovey, lovey feel.

1574
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:23,044
I think mr. Wells and swearnet
need an intervention, logi.

1575
01:06:26,482 --> 01:06:29,584
Holy fuck, boys,
this acim's awesode, man!

1576
01:06:29,586 --> 01:06:30,819
I've got the hunger.

1577
01:06:30,821 --> 01:06:32,754
What's that?

1578
01:06:32,756 --> 01:06:34,422
- I've got the hunger!
- I'm hungry.

1579
01:06:34,424 --> 01:06:36,091
- All right.
- You know what?

1580
01:06:36,093 --> 01:06:37,092
We could do an awesome fuckin'
bit for swearnet -

1581
01:06:37,094 --> 01:06:38,927
a cookin' show.

1582
01:06:38,929 --> 01:06:40,161
What's the most fucked up thing

1583
01:06:40,163 --> 01:06:41,403
we could cook and eat
right now?

1584
01:06:43,099 --> 01:06:45,000
Pat!

1585
01:06:45,002 --> 01:06:48,937
<i>Pat! I want the brains!</i>

1586
01:06:48,939 --> 01:06:50,438
Hi, there,
welcome to "acid canibals".

1587
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:52,440
I'm your host, mike smith.

1588
01:06:52,442 --> 01:06:54,442
Let's cook this fucker!

1589
01:06:54,444 --> 01:06:57,612
Looks to be a 240 pound
himalayan shitbeast!

1590
01:07:01,951 --> 01:07:03,952
More sauce! More sauce!

1591
01:07:03,954 --> 01:07:06,955
Yeah, ground pepper.

1592
01:07:06,957 --> 01:07:08,456
Guys, how are you feelin'
about the race in the morning?

1593
01:07:08,458 --> 01:07:10,792
We've got some bald
pussy tequila.

1594
01:07:10,794 --> 01:07:12,961
And then for the fatty layer
we're gonna dissolve it

1595
01:07:12,963 --> 01:07:15,663
with some liquormen's
old dirty canadian whiskey.

1596
01:07:15,665 --> 01:07:16,798
To make it crispy.

1597
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,133
Holy fuck!

1598
01:07:19,202 --> 01:07:21,302
What the fuck?!

1599
01:07:21,304 --> 01:07:23,138
Get me the fuck-

1600
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:25,840
unfucking tie me,
for fuck's sakes!

1601
01:07:25,842 --> 01:07:28,476
Smith, you fuckin' untie
me right the fuck now!

1602
01:07:28,478 --> 01:07:29,878
You shut your fuckin'
mouth shut!

1603
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:31,980
- You fuckin' shut up!
- I'm fuckin'...

1604
01:07:33,683 --> 01:07:36,217
Get me the fuck out of here,
smith!

1605
01:07:36,219 --> 01:07:38,153
Fuckin' untie me
right fuckin' now!

1606
01:07:38,155 --> 01:07:40,755
This is not fuckin' funny!
For fuck sakes!

1607
01:07:54,037 --> 01:07:56,337
Boys, I don't wanna freak
you out, but...

1608
01:07:56,339 --> 01:07:57,872
It's about two hours
till race time.

1609
01:07:57,874 --> 01:07:59,507
How are you guys feelin'?

1610
01:08:04,181 --> 01:08:07,248
He said he's 100 percent,
fuckwad.

1611
01:08:10,253 --> 01:08:12,087
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to day one

1612
01:08:12,089 --> 01:08:13,388
<i>of the east coast targa,</i>

1613
01:08:13,390 --> 01:08:15,523
<i>we'll be getting underway</i>
<i>shortly.</i>

1614
01:08:15,525 --> 01:08:17,525
<i>Just a reminder there are still</i>
<i>tickets available</i>

1615
01:08:17,527 --> 01:08:19,094
<i>for the final stages...</i>

1616
01:08:21,030 --> 01:08:22,864
Walk straight now, straight up.

1617
01:08:24,034 --> 01:08:25,600
Holy fuck.

1618
01:08:25,602 --> 01:08:26,601
It's like a buffalo
with 400 balls.

1619
01:08:26,603 --> 01:08:28,236
You've gotta avoid
shit like that.

1620
01:08:28,238 --> 01:08:30,105
That's a trigger, man.

1621
01:08:30,107 --> 01:08:32,440
That'll send you right on
the next train to laughy town.

1622
01:08:32,442 --> 01:08:35,944
You gotta focus here.
It's comin' in waves now.

1623
01:08:35,946 --> 01:08:38,279
We can control this.
Keep your eyes to the ground.

1624
01:08:38,281 --> 01:08:39,380
Don't look anybody, okay?

1625
01:08:39,382 --> 01:08:40,748
- Got it.
- Don't look at any-

1626
01:08:40,750 --> 01:08:42,250
oh, we got a greasy bogie
to the right, man.

1627
01:08:42,252 --> 01:08:43,084
Don't look at it.

1628
01:08:43,086 --> 01:08:44,085
Ah, ah, uh...

1629
01:08:45,255 --> 01:08:47,555
Hi!

1630
01:08:47,557 --> 01:08:50,258
All right, you did good, man.

1631
01:08:50,260 --> 01:08:52,127
Just keep avoiding those
fuckin' triggers, all right?

1632
01:08:52,129 --> 01:08:54,262
Avoid fuckin' triggers.

1633
01:08:54,264 --> 01:08:55,563
<i>Folks, it has just been brought</i>
<i>to my attention</i>

1636
01:09:00,237 --> 01:09:02,637

race car.

1637
01:09:02,639 --> 01:09:04,572
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, god!

1638
01:09:04,574 --> 01:09:07,075
Push the memberships.

Oh, good to have you with us,
fellas.

1644
01:09:19,456 --> 01:09:21,422
You mind personalizing
that for me?

1645
01:09:21,424 --> 01:09:22,424
That's fuckin' beautiful.

1646
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:26,161
What is your name?

1647
01:09:26,163 --> 01:09:28,096
The name's carl,

1648
01:09:28,098 --> 01:09:30,058
but the boys down at the gun
club call me trigger.

1649
01:09:33,103 --> 01:09:35,270
I'm fuckin' sorry about that!

1650
01:09:35,272 --> 01:09:39,340
Uh, jesus, do you want
me to get that for ya?

1651
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:43,919
What the hell is wrong
with you guys?

1652
01:09:47,283 --> 01:09:50,685
Oh my god!

1653
01:09:50,687 --> 01:09:52,487
What the hell is wrong
with you guys?

1654
01:09:52,489 --> 01:09:54,956
<i>It looks like</i>
<i>your mother's pussy.</i>

1655
01:09:54,958 --> 01:09:56,958
How do you know what
my mother's pussy looks like?

1656
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:59,027
It looks just like that.

1657
01:10:02,298 --> 01:10:05,133
I'm surprised you boys passed
the goddamn breathalyzers!

1658
01:10:05,135 --> 01:10:07,335
We haven't had a drink.

1659
01:10:07,337 --> 01:10:09,370
Okay, let's clear out,
show's over.

1660
01:10:09,372 --> 01:10:12,140

Thank you, thank you.

1663
01:10:19,715 --> 01:10:22,016
- Are you guys okay?
- What's wrong?

1664
01:10:22,018 --> 01:10:25,220
We were telling jokes
about shit.

1665
01:10:25,222 --> 01:10:26,654
We're fine.

1666
01:10:26,656 --> 01:10:30,058
All right, get in there.

1667
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:31,392
You assholes are gonna pay
for what you did last night!

1668
01:10:31,394 --> 01:10:33,328
That shit wasn't even funny!

1669
01:10:33,330 --> 01:10:35,730
Fuck you!

1670

All right,

1671
01:10:39,668 --> 01:10:41,736
Okay, no fuckin' around,
all right?

1672
01:10:43,672 --> 01:10:45,173
Are you fucked in the head?!

1673
01:10:45,175 --> 01:10:46,241
- What?
- If you would've passed out

1674
01:10:46,243 --> 01:10:49,010
they were gonna cook me
and eat me!

1675
01:10:49,012 --> 01:10:50,345
Pat, I wouldn't have let them
fuckin' cook and eat you.

1676
01:10:50,347 --> 01:10:53,047
Think about that.
Give me corn dog.

1677
01:10:53,049 --> 01:10:55,183
- Fuck off!
- I'm fuckin' starvin'!

1678
01:10:55,185 --> 01:10:58,386
You're taking this swearnet
stuff too fuckin' far, smith!

1679
01:10:58,388 --> 01:11:00,555
Pat, I'm in over my fuckin'
head here, man.

1680
01:11:00,557 --> 01:11:01,689
Look, I gotta make
a huge payment

1681
01:11:01,691 --> 01:11:03,258
to pinchcocksucker tomorrow

1682
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:05,026
and I don't have
the fuckin' money.

1683
01:11:05,028 --> 01:11:06,894
We gotta sell subscriptions
here, man.

1684
01:11:06,896 --> 01:11:08,730
Swearman might be the only
person that can do this.

1685
01:11:08,732 --> 01:11:10,412
You gotta help me.
People fuckin' love you.

1686
01:11:12,201 --> 01:11:14,702
They do? Yes, they fuckin' do.

1687
01:11:14,704 --> 01:11:16,271
Hey, it's swearman, everybody!

1688
01:11:16,273 --> 01:11:17,305
Yeah!

1689
01:11:19,208 --> 01:11:21,409
Right on.

1690
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:32,287
- How are you feeling, buddy?
- What's your confidence level?

1691
01:11:32,289 --> 01:11:35,790
- I feel fucking fantastic, robb!
- Come on!

1692
01:11:35,792 --> 01:11:37,353
Are you ready for battle,
young warrior?

1693
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:47,935
- Okay, get ready.
- Three, two, one, hit it!

1694
01:11:50,907 --> 01:11:52,407
- What the fuck, man?

1695
01:11:52,409 --> 01:11:54,909
Fuckin' neutral!

1696
01:11:59,415 --> 01:12:01,316
Smith, heights freak me

1697
01:12:01,318 --> 01:12:03,785
I'm not sittin'
by the fuckin' window!

1698
01:12:03,787 --> 01:12:05,486
It's okay, buddy,
you won't have to.

1699
01:12:11,427 --> 01:12:13,094
Okay, buddy,
get your helmet on!

1700
01:12:13,096 --> 01:12:14,829
- All right.
- I still don't know

1701
01:12:14,831 --> 01:12:17,098
what swearman has to do
with this shot?

1702
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:19,334
Swearman's critical
to this shot!

1703
01:12:23,939 --> 01:12:26,174
Sorry.

1704
01:12:26,176 --> 01:12:28,343
The video's gotta be insane,
man, I've done this before!

1705
01:12:28,345 --> 01:12:30,311
It's gonna blow
your fuckin' mind!

1706
01:12:30,313 --> 01:12:33,381
Smith, you cocksucker,
what the hell are doin'?!

1707
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:35,683
<i>Shit! Shit! Shit!</i>

1708
01:12:35,685 --> 01:12:37,618
<i>Watch out for the fuckin'-</i>
<i>oh shit!</i>

1709
01:12:37,620 --> 01:12:39,287
I got it, man,
this is fuckin' awesome!

1710
01:12:44,627 --> 01:12:47,328
Get the fuck outta the way!

1711
01:12:47,330 --> 01:12:49,864
Fuckin' shepherds!

1712
01:12:49,866 --> 01:12:51,299
We're handing out key chains.

1713
01:12:51,301 --> 01:12:52,367
Fuck off, shepherds!

1714
01:12:56,805 --> 01:12:58,306
<i>I still can't believe</i>
<i>that orange-headed fuck</i>

1715
01:12:58,308 --> 01:13:01,209
<i>was chucking key chains at me!</i>

1716
01:13:01,211 --> 01:13:03,211
Stop think about carrot cock
and get back into this!

1717
01:13:03,213 --> 01:13:05,546
Carrot cock!

1718
01:13:07,517 --> 01:13:09,050
All right, okay,

1719
01:13:09,052 --> 01:13:10,017
I'm getting hit
by another wave.

1720
01:13:10,019 --> 01:13:11,319
Just settle the fuck down!

1721
01:13:14,823 --> 01:13:16,391
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

1722
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:20,395
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

1723
01:13:24,333 --> 01:13:26,334
- What is that?

1724
01:13:26,336 --> 01:13:27,835
Fuck!

1725
01:13:27,837 --> 01:13:29,904
Fuck!

1726
01:13:33,576 --> 01:13:34,475
Ahhhhhhhhhhh!

1727
01:13:37,346 --> 01:13:39,247
- Come on, swearman!

1728
01:13:39,249 --> 01:13:41,682
- Fuck you, smith!
- Just get me the fuck down!

1729
01:13:41,684 --> 01:13:44,585
You are gonna fuckin' kill me!

1730
01:13:44,587 --> 01:13:47,588
He is not fuckin' lookin' good!

1731
01:13:50,727 --> 01:13:51,959
- Jesus christ!

1732
01:13:53,929 --> 01:13:56,531
What the fuck was that?!

1733
01:13:56,533 --> 01:13:58,533
Smith, swearman just exploded,
man.

1734
01:13:58,535 --> 01:14:00,401
Is he okay?

1735
01:14:00,403 --> 01:14:01,769
I'm sorry!

1736
01:14:01,771 --> 01:14:03,538
Swearman!

1737
01:14:03,540 --> 01:14:05,273
That was fucked up!

1738
01:14:05,275 --> 01:14:08,242
Oh, fuck,
that feels better now!

1739
01:14:08,244 --> 01:14:10,044
Swearman, do a shout out!

1740
01:14:10,046 --> 01:14:11,646
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

1741
01:14:14,049 --> 01:14:18,085
I'm not cleanin' this fuckin'

1742
01:14:18,087 --> 01:14:19,287
Fuck.

Swearman, you okay, buddy?!

1744
01:14:29,766 --> 01:14:33,067
Smith!
That was fuckin' amazing!

1745
01:14:33,069 --> 01:14:35,436
I was flyin'!

1746
01:14:35,438 --> 01:14:37,572
It was awesome, man!

1747
01:14:37,574 --> 01:14:40,408
Fuckin' a! Oh my god!

1748

Right the fuck on!

1758

That was fuckin' amazing, man.

1759
01:15:07,937 --> 01:15:09,804
That cocksucker'd be so proud
of you for today.

1760
01:15:09,806 --> 01:15:11,506
- Thanks, man.
- Awesome!

- Amazing!
- I know!

1763
01:15:15,278 --> 01:15:16,811
Swearman, the fuckin' footage
looks incredible!

1764
01:15:16,813 --> 01:15:18,012
I'm fuckin' starvin'!

1765
01:15:18,014 --> 01:15:20,114
You fuckin' stink.

1766
01:15:20,116 --> 01:15:21,449
This is really comin' together,
boys.

1767
01:15:21,451 --> 01:15:24,118
Mike! You're being sued
by cnt?!

1768
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:25,152
Why didn't you tell
me about this?!

1769
01:15:25,154 --> 01:15:26,621
What?

1770
01:15:26,623 --> 01:15:27,688
I got it under control.

1771
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:29,624
Oh really?!

1772
01:15:29,626 --> 01:15:31,692
Because I would have never
gotten involved

1773
01:15:31,694 --> 01:15:33,327
if I knew you were being sued!

1774
01:15:33,329 --> 01:15:34,529
Okay, he said he has it
under control.

1775
01:15:34,531 --> 01:15:36,998
It's not a fuckin' big deal!

1776
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,667
The sponsors,
they're pulling the cars.

1777
01:15:39,669 --> 01:15:41,669
I'm sorry.
There's nothing I can do.

1778
01:15:41,671 --> 01:15:43,337
What the fuck
are you talkin' about?!

1779
01:15:43,339 --> 01:15:45,473
That's the most ridiculous
fuckin' thing I ever heard!

1780
01:15:45,475 --> 01:15:46,674
Are you surprised? Really?

1781
01:15:48,678 --> 01:15:49,810
Sorry to do this, boys,

1782
01:15:49,812 --> 01:15:51,679
but I'm gonna have
to disqualify ya.

1783
01:15:51,681 --> 01:15:53,648
What are you talkin' about?

1784
01:15:53,650 --> 01:15:55,983
Racing under the influence
of a controlled substance?

1785
01:15:55,985 --> 01:15:59,554
Does this look familiar?

1786
01:15:59,556 --> 01:16:00,821
What does the east coast
targa people gonna think

1787
01:16:00,823 --> 01:16:03,324
when they find out
we're on fuckin' acid!

1788
01:16:03,326 --> 01:16:04,725
Lsd, baby! Yeah!

1789
01:16:06,495 --> 01:16:08,229
- No.

<i>Trigger, fuck off!</i>

1791
01:16:09,866 --> 01:16:11,899
They're not actually on acid,
for fuck sakes!

1792
01:16:11,901 --> 01:16:13,334
I shot that.
We were fuckin' around.

1793
01:16:13,336 --> 01:16:14,702
They're just acting.

1794
01:16:14,704 --> 01:16:16,904
Son, do I look stupid to you?

1795
01:16:18,674 --> 01:16:19,907
I've seen your show.

1796
01:16:19,909 --> 01:16:21,876
They're not that good
at acting.

1797
01:16:21,878 --> 01:16:23,511
Sorry, boys,
that's the way it is.

1798
01:16:23,513 --> 01:16:24,712
Come on!

1799
01:16:24,714 --> 01:16:26,747
Jesus christ, mike!

1800
01:16:26,749 --> 01:16:28,015
Jamie, I'm fuckin' sorry!

01:16:28,017 --> 01:16:29,550
I'm trying not to go
tits up here!

1802
01:16:29,552 --> 01:16:32,386
I'm under a lot
of fuckin' pressure!

1803
01:16:32,388 --> 01:16:34,522
You couldn't just take
one fuckin' day off

1804
01:16:34,524 --> 01:16:35,856
of swearnet, could ya?

1805
01:16:35,858 --> 01:16:37,725
No, I fuckin' couldn't,
actually!

1806
01:16:37,727 --> 01:16:39,527
There's houses gettin'
burned down and shit!

1807

<i>Yeah, and why is that</i>
<i>happenin'?</i>

1808
01:16:40,763 --> 01:16:42,430
'Cause you made a fuckin'
deal without a lunatic

1809
01:16:42,432 --> 01:16:43,898
and you didn't even ask us!

1810
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:45,066
You know what I hope
you're proud of yourself,

1811
01:16:45,068 --> 01:16:46,767
because I'm fuckin' done
with swearnet...

1812
01:16:46,769 --> 01:16:47,768
Oh, come on!

1813
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:48,769
And I'm fuckin' done with you!

1814
01:16:48,771 --> 01:16:50,705
- Jape!
- Thank you!

1815
01:16:50,707 --> 01:16:52,373
Fuckin' asshole!

1816
01:16:52,375 --> 01:16:54,709
What were you thinking,
mike? God!

1817
01:16:54,711 --> 01:16:55,943
We can figure this out.

1818
01:16:55,945 --> 01:16:57,578
I hope so.

1819
01:16:57,580 --> 01:16:58,613
Fucking lying piece of shit!

1820
01:16:58,615 --> 01:17:00,281
<i>Oh, here you go.</i>

1821
01:17:00,283 --> 01:17:01,248
Is this why you never came
home last night, huh?

1822
01:17:01,250 --> 01:17:02,883
Because you're fucking
this bitch?!

1823
01:17:02,885 --> 01:17:05,720
You fucking slut!
You're not even hot,

1824
01:17:05,722 --> 01:17:07,722
and you're very short.

1825
01:17:07,724 --> 01:17:09,457
You better back the fuck up

1826
01:17:09,459 --> 01:17:10,725
with those too-close
together-fucking eyes,

1827
01:17:10,727 --> 01:17:12,460
you crazy cunt!

1828
01:17:14,897 --> 01:17:16,797
And put some fucking
clothes on!

1829
01:17:18,734 --> 01:17:20,067
I didn't fucking cheat on you,
okay?!

1830
01:17:20,069 --> 01:17:21,469
She likes mike anyway!

1831
01:17:21,471 --> 01:17:23,237
What?!

1832
01:17:23,239 --> 01:17:25,306
No, I don't.

1833
01:17:25,308 --> 01:17:26,941
Look, I didn't come home
last night,

1834
01:17:26,943 --> 01:17:28,743
'cause mike accidentally
gave me acid.

1835
01:17:28,745 --> 01:17:29,810
He thought it was
liquid codeine.

1836
01:17:29,812 --> 01:17:31,612
Okay, that's it.

1837
01:17:31,614 --> 01:17:33,481
Well, I accidentally sucked

1838
01:17:33,483 --> 01:17:35,950
sebastian bach's cock
again last night!

1839
01:17:35,952 --> 01:17:37,585
Oh my god.

1840
01:17:37,587 --> 01:17:39,620
Oops.

1841
01:17:39,622 --> 01:17:42,256
You know what? This is perfect.

1842
01:17:42,258 --> 01:17:44,091
I'm glad you cheated on me.

1843
01:17:44,093 --> 01:17:45,793
<i>But I didn't cheat on you.</i>

1844
01:17:45,795 --> 01:17:47,161
How could you suck
his cock again

1845
01:17:47,163 --> 01:17:48,095
after all we went through
the first time?

1846
01:17:48,097 --> 01:17:49,764
Maybe you shoulda answered

1847
01:17:49,766 --> 01:17:51,599
your fucking phone
when I called you!

1848
01:17:51,601 --> 01:17:53,634
Jp smashed my fuckin' phone!
Bull shit!

1849
01:17:53,636 --> 01:17:55,670
That's why I didn't answer it!

1850
01:17:55,672 --> 01:17:56,771
You can keep
the piece of shit house.

1851
01:17:56,773 --> 01:17:58,806
I'm taking everything else.

1852
01:17:58,808 --> 01:18:01,776
And just so you know,
I'm going on tour

1853
01:18:01,778 --> 01:18:04,311

and his beautiful...

1854
01:18:04,313 --> 01:18:05,946
No.

1855
01:18:05,948 --> 01:18:07,982
Breathtaking cock.

1856
01:18:07,984 --> 01:18:09,784
Have a nice life with
your idiot friends,

1857
01:18:09,786 --> 01:18:11,118

1858
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:13,454
Julie, don't, please!

1859
01:18:13,456 --> 01:18:15,122
- Suck it for me!
- Fuck you, mike!

1860
01:18:15,124 --> 01:18:16,791
You shut your fuckin' mouth!

1861
01:18:16,793 --> 01:18:18,793
Thanks, man!

1862
01:18:18,795 --> 01:18:21,629
Robb, come on, man, don't
fuckin' quit on me please!

1863
01:18:21,631 --> 01:18:23,964
I can't fuckin' do this
on my own, man.

1864
01:18:23,966 --> 01:18:26,033
What a corn dog, man?

1865
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:31,372
Robb, it's never as bad as
you think it's gonna be, man!

1866
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:39,146
Good evening, I'm bj wilson,

1867
01:18:39,148 --> 01:18:41,182
with a cnt breaking
news update.

1868
01:18:41,184 --> 01:18:42,983
The former trailer park boys

1869
01:18:42,985 --> 01:18:45,319
are making headlines again
this afternoon.

1870
01:18:45,321 --> 01:18:47,855
After their internet-based
network, swearnet,

1871
01:18:47,857 --> 01:18:49,223
<i>was slapped with</i>
<i>fourteen law suits</i>

1872
01:18:49,225 --> 01:18:52,493
<i>totalling 4.5 million dollars.</i>

1873
01:18:52,495 --> 01:18:54,495
<i>Mike smith, robb wells,</i>
<i>jp tremblay and patrick roach,</i>

1874
01:18:54,497 --> 01:18:58,699
<i>a. K.A. Swearman,</i>
<i>are all named on the law suits,</i>

1875
01:18:58,701 --> 01:19:00,868
none of whom could be reached
for comments,

1876
01:19:00,870 --> 01:19:02,203
but I think it's safe to assume

1877
01:19:02,205 --> 01:19:04,839
this spells the end
for swearnet.

1878
01:19:04,841 --> 01:19:06,540
<i>Up next,</i>
<i>local religious sect...</i>

1879
01:19:06,542 --> 01:19:08,843
Fuck you, you cocksuckers.

1880
01:19:08,845 --> 01:19:10,578
Religion or-

1881
01:19:21,857 --> 01:19:25,025
I just wanted everybody
to know that robb and jp

1882
01:19:25,027 --> 01:19:27,394
probably won't be
on swearnet anymore

1883
01:19:27,396 --> 01:19:29,930
because I fucking ruined
both of their lives.

1884
01:19:34,369 --> 01:19:35,770
I didn't mean to, but I did.

1885
01:19:37,706 --> 01:19:38,939
I'm fuckin' sorry.

1886
01:19:41,877 --> 01:19:43,878
All I wanted was for
the three of us

1887
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:45,120
to be able to make people laugh

1888
01:19:46,715 --> 01:19:49,884
and not be fuckin' censored,

1889
01:19:49,886 --> 01:19:51,485
and it all went to shit.

1890
01:19:55,891 --> 01:19:58,793
Jape, if you're watchin' this,
man,

1891
01:19:58,795 --> 01:20:00,127
I fuckin' love you, brother.

1892
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:05,065
I'm goin' down to the fuckin'
targa office in the morning

1893
01:20:05,067 --> 01:20:08,969
and I am gonna tell pussy-eye

1894
01:20:08,971 --> 01:20:12,239
that he has to let you and your
dad cross that finish line,

1895
01:20:12,241 --> 01:20:14,475
and I don't give a fuck
what I have to do.

1896
01:20:19,414 --> 01:20:22,283
I'm gonna make it happen,
brother.

1897
01:20:22,285 --> 01:20:25,753
I don't care.
I fuckin' love you.

1898
01:20:25,755 --> 01:20:28,422
I love you both, man.
You're both my fuckin' brothers

1899
01:20:28,424 --> 01:20:31,992
and I will do whatever
the fuck I have to do

1900
01:20:31,994 --> 01:20:34,762
to make this shit happen, man.

1901
01:20:34,764 --> 01:20:37,598
<i>I fuckin' love you guys.</i>

1902

<i>I really fuckin' love you guys.</i>

1903
01:20:42,437 --> 01:20:45,673
I love you both, man,
I love you both.

1904
01:20:45,675 --> 01:20:47,575
<i>You're my brothers!</i>

1905
01:20:48,610 --> 01:20:53,781
<i>Jape, I fuckin' love you, man.</i>
<i>I love you, man.</i>

1906
01:21:02,658 --> 01:21:06,360

I love you, guys!

1931
01:22:22,204 --> 01:22:24,705
I'm goin' in there to get
the boys back in the race!

1932
01:22:24,707 --> 01:22:25,739
I'm not gonna take no
for an answer!

Swearnet. Com!

1934

Swearnet! Swearnet! Swearnet!

1935
01:22:30,579 --> 01:22:32,780
Swearnet! Swearnet! Swearnet!

1936
01:22:45,961 --> 01:22:47,261
Do any of you guys know how to
turn off this god damn sound?

1937
01:22:47,263 --> 01:22:49,296
I do. Here.

1938
01:22:49,298 --> 01:22:50,731
<i>I woke up this morning,</i>
<i>15,000 emails.</i>

1939
01:22:50,733 --> 01:22:53,100
<i>It hasn't stopped yet!</i>

1940
01:22:53,102 --> 01:22:55,569
Everybody's calling
me pussy eye.

1941
01:22:55,571 --> 01:22:59,406
<i>Aw, for the love of christ,</i>
<i>20,000 emails now!</i>

1942
01:22:59,408 --> 01:23:00,908
Well, can you imagine
if we flip this around

1943
01:23:00,910 --> 01:23:03,310
and actually got swearnet
behind the fuckin' race.

1944
01:23:03,312 --> 01:23:04,979
Let me make myself
perfectly clear.

1945
01:23:04,981 --> 01:23:07,081
There's nothin' you can say

1946
01:23:07,083 --> 01:23:08,916
that's gonna get
me to change my mind.

1947
01:23:08,918 --> 01:23:10,985
They broke the rules!

1948
01:23:10,987 --> 01:23:13,620
Look, trigger,

1949
01:23:13,622 --> 01:23:15,456
all jp wants is to do is cross
the fuckin' finish line

1950
01:23:15,458 --> 01:23:17,091
with his dad next to him.

1951
01:23:17,093 --> 01:23:19,159
<i>Come on!</i>

1952
01:23:19,161 --> 01:23:20,928
These guys are
my fuckin' family.

1953
01:23:20,930 --> 01:23:23,931
I would take fucking bullet
in the face for them.

1954
01:23:23,933 --> 01:23:25,973
Jeez, you'd do anything
for them boys, wouldn't you?

1955
01:23:29,104 --> 01:23:30,037
Yeah. Anything.

1956
01:23:42,117 --> 01:23:43,851
¶ Think I'm gonna stay
for a while ¶

1957
01:23:48,123 --> 01:23:49,724
¶ just to beg for a whisper
and a smile ¶

1958
01:23:57,799 --> 01:24:00,200

with your face and style ¶

1959
01:24:00,202 --> 01:24:01,201
hey, come on in!

1960
01:24:09,978 --> 01:24:10,899
Uh, robb, are you here?

1961
01:24:16,484 --> 01:24:18,152
Hey. Excuse the mess.

1962
01:24:18,154 --> 01:24:22,056
I haven't had a chance
to clean up.

1963
01:24:22,058 --> 01:24:25,159
Hey, I totally understand.
You've been through a lot.

1964
01:24:28,663 --> 01:24:31,999
Wow!

1965
01:24:32,001 --> 01:24:33,167
Quite a fuckin' thing.

1966
01:24:35,237 --> 01:24:38,572
I mean, not a fuckin' thing.
It's a fucked up thing.

1967
01:24:38,574 --> 01:24:41,842
Oh, I mean, that part there is
a fucking thing I guess but...

1968
01:24:47,182 --> 01:24:50,050
Look, rob, just so you know,

1969
01:24:50,052 --> 01:24:51,919
I like you, not mike.

1970
01:24:54,189 --> 01:24:56,757
Really?
I was sure you liked mike

1971
01:24:56,759 --> 01:24:58,559
and I see the way
he looks at ya,

1972
01:24:58,561 --> 01:25:01,095
and a lot of women find him
irresistible

1973
01:25:01,097 --> 01:25:02,529
and that sort of stuff.

1974
01:25:02,531 --> 01:25:04,765
I just assumed you probably
like him not me-

1975
01:25:13,374 --> 01:25:14,942
wow, I was not expecting that.

1976
01:25:17,378 --> 01:25:20,547
Or that.

1977
01:25:20,549 --> 01:25:22,382
That's fuckin' hilarious!

1978
01:25:25,121 --> 01:25:26,801
What's going on,
you hungarian fuck tanker?

1979
01:25:28,623 --> 01:25:30,624
What?

1980
01:25:30,626 --> 01:25:31,892
How'd he get you back
in the race?

1981
01:25:31,894 --> 01:25:33,560
Oh fuck.

1982
01:25:33,562 --> 01:25:37,064
Who the fuck's piece of shit
car is that?!

1983
01:25:37,066 --> 01:25:38,799
Oh! Well if it isn't
the happy couple!

1984
01:25:41,636 --> 01:25:43,770
Yay!

1985
01:25:43,772 --> 01:25:45,105
I don't want to fucking fight,
julie, okay?

1986
01:25:45,107 --> 01:25:47,107
Fight?

1987
01:25:47,109 --> 01:25:50,310
What? You don't fight, rob.

1988
01:25:50,312 --> 01:25:52,312
You stand there like
a little bitch

1989
01:25:52,314 --> 01:25:54,114
and take whatever I give you!

1990
01:25:54,116 --> 01:25:57,417
You're a fuckin' pussy!

1991
01:25:57,419 --> 01:25:58,785
But it doesn't matter
now anyways now,

1992
01:25:58,787 --> 01:26:01,321
because I have a real man
and he has his own tour bus!

1993
01:26:03,258 --> 01:26:05,592
Good for you.
Go get on the tour bus.

1994
01:26:05,594 --> 01:26:08,762
I forgot my passport,
which I need

1995
01:26:08,764 --> 01:26:12,933
because my boyfriend,
who is way more famous

1996
01:26:12,935 --> 01:26:15,669
and gloriously bigger
than you by the way,

1997
01:26:15,671 --> 01:26:19,106
is taking me on an
around the world tour.

1998
01:26:19,108 --> 01:26:21,141
10 countries,

1999
01:26:21,143 --> 01:26:24,144
2 months, all expenses paid.

2000
01:26:24,146 --> 01:26:26,280
Woo!

2001
01:26:29,351 --> 01:26:30,684
What? Oh fuck! Fuck!

2002
01:26:33,288 --> 01:26:36,623
I'll see you later,
you crazy fuckin' bitch!

2003
01:26:36,625 --> 01:26:39,960
Get the fuck back here,
you fucking asshole!

2004
01:26:39,962 --> 01:26:42,629
Loco!

2005
01:26:42,631 --> 01:26:45,499
Bitch, read my ass!

2006
01:26:45,501 --> 01:26:46,867
I'm sorry about all this.

2007
01:26:46,869 --> 01:26:48,635
Don't even worry about it.

2008
01:26:48,637 --> 01:26:50,537
- Do you fuckin' hear me?!
- Come on! No!

2009
01:26:53,308 --> 01:26:56,310
Wait for me!
You forgot to take me with you!

2010
01:26:56,312 --> 01:26:58,212
Hey, you crazy fuckin' asshole!

2011
01:27:01,549 --> 01:27:04,184
<i>Fuck you!</i>
<i>Your cock's not even that big!</i>

2012
01:27:04,186 --> 01:27:06,386
<i>You cocksucker!</i>

2013
01:27:06,388 --> 01:27:08,222
<i>Hey, sebastian!</i>

2014
01:27:18,499 --> 01:27:19,833
Got some good news, buddy!

2015
01:27:19,835 --> 01:27:21,235
Oh yeah, what?

2016
01:27:21,237 --> 01:27:22,536
Mike got you back in the race.

2017
01:27:22,538 --> 01:27:24,738
Mike can eat my shit.

2018
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:26,506
If that's truly what you want
I'll do it, buddy.

2019
01:27:26,508 --> 01:27:29,843
It wouldn't even fuckin'
phase me at this point.

2020
01:27:29,845 --> 01:27:32,012
He really took one for the team
today at trigger's.

2021
01:27:32,014 --> 01:27:33,347
I don't know how he pulled
it off,

2022
01:27:33,349 --> 01:27:35,349
but it was amazing.
It was fucking mythical!

2023
01:27:35,351 --> 01:27:38,418
Pat, fuckin' relax.

2024
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:40,354
<i>I did get you back in the race.</i>

2025
01:27:40,356 --> 01:27:42,089
Let me guess,

2026
01:27:42,091 --> 01:27:43,690
so you can shoot the whole
fuckin' thing for swearnet.

2027
01:27:43,692 --> 01:27:47,227
Jape, look, I swear to fuck
the only thing I care about

2028
01:27:47,229 --> 01:27:50,697
is you crossing that
finish line with your dad.

2029
01:27:50,699 --> 01:27:54,201
<i>That's what I'd like to shoot.</i>
<i>If you're cool with it.</i>

2030
01:27:54,203 --> 01:27:55,369
You being serious right now?

2031
01:27:58,773 --> 01:28:00,274
All right, let's hug it out.

2032
01:28:04,213 --> 01:28:08,048
Don't you ever, ever,
fuck me over again!

2033
01:28:08,050 --> 01:28:10,284
All right.

2034
01:28:10,286 --> 01:28:12,619
Okay, thank you,
thank you so much.

2035
01:28:12,621 --> 01:28:16,556
I'm with the guys right now.
I will let them know.

2036
01:28:16,558 --> 01:28:19,926
Guys, I have great news.
Are you okay?

2037
01:28:19,928 --> 01:28:22,896
- Yeah, my balls got mashed.

2038
01:28:22,898 --> 01:28:25,299
So the sponsors are getting
thousands of emails

2039
01:28:25,301 --> 01:28:28,235
from people who wanna see
you guys finish the race.

2040
01:28:28,237 --> 01:28:30,070
You shut your sexy little
mouth! Are you serious?

2041
01:28:30,072 --> 01:28:31,338
Happy?!

2042
01:28:33,241 --> 01:28:35,309
That is awesome.

2043
01:28:35,311 --> 01:28:36,910
What the fuck
is that all about?

2044
01:28:36,912 --> 01:28:38,645
- What?
- You fucker.

2045
01:28:38,647 --> 01:28:40,147
So what do you think, man?

2046
01:28:40,149 --> 01:28:41,248
You wanna fuckin' finish
this thing or what?

2047
01:28:41,250 --> 01:28:43,583
Let's win this fuckin' race.

2048
01:28:43,585 --> 01:28:45,752
Fuckin' right on, boys.

2049
01:28:45,754 --> 01:28:47,921
Swearman, I'll go grab
your fuckin' suit.

2050
01:28:47,923 --> 01:28:50,957
Boys, meet me down
at the track.

2051
01:28:50,959 --> 01:28:52,492
So what are you doin' there?

2052
01:28:52,494 --> 01:28:53,460
'Cause that wouldn't really
do anything to fix the car.

2053
01:28:53,462 --> 01:28:54,428
It just looks stupid.

2054
01:29:05,106 --> 01:29:06,640
Jesus fuckin' christ,
I can't deal with you right now

2055
01:29:06,642 --> 01:29:08,675
you fucking psychotic prick!

2056
01:29:08,677 --> 01:29:11,611
Fuck off, pinchbeck!

2057
01:29:11,613 --> 01:29:12,846
Satan's clit!

2058
01:29:14,449 --> 01:29:17,150
Good morning, mr. Smith.

2059
01:29:17,152 --> 01:29:19,319
Mr. Smith,

2060
01:29:19,321 --> 01:29:21,555
curious as to why you refuse
to return my calls.

2061
01:29:23,791 --> 01:29:26,159
Wouldn't you agree it would be
rather unfortunate

2062
01:29:26,161 --> 01:29:28,862
if you were all to misplace,
say, well, your feet?

2063
01:29:32,534 --> 01:29:34,368
Okay, I'm startin'
to understand

2064
01:29:34,370 --> 01:29:36,136
your cryptic fuckin' lingo
a little better here.

2065
01:29:36,138 --> 01:29:37,838
Clearly you just said
that logi's gonna

2066
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:40,507
<i>chop our fuckin' feet off,</i>
<i>correct?</i>

2067
01:29:40,509 --> 01:29:42,976
What the fuck can I do here
to end this once and for all?

2068
01:29:42,978 --> 01:29:45,045
<i>All right, mr. Smith,</i>

2069
01:29:45,047 --> 01:29:48,482
$100,000 and logi and I get
our very own show on swearnet

2070
01:29:48,484 --> 01:29:51,985
and we'll call it even.

2071
01:29:51,987 --> 01:29:56,690
Are you fuckin' insane?!
$100,000 to pay off 20 grand?!

2072
01:29:56,692 --> 01:30:00,527
That oughta keep a bounce
in your step.

2073
01:30:00,529 --> 01:30:01,895
More cryptic shit.

2074
01:30:10,405 --> 01:30:12,739
Hey, tom, carrot!

2075
01:30:12,741 --> 01:30:13,707
Oh great, the guy who fucked up

2076
01:30:13,709 --> 01:30:14,708
the whole weekend
for everybody.

2077
01:30:14,710 --> 01:30:16,410
Yeah, listen, look, man,

2078
01:30:16,412 --> 01:30:17,878
I know you don't fuckin'
owe me anything

2079
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:19,679
or probably even give
a fuck, but-

2080
01:30:19,681 --> 01:30:22,182
no, we don't give a fuck.

2081
01:30:22,184 --> 01:30:24,518
I got me and the boys into
a really fucked up situation

2082
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:26,920
and I need your help.

2083
01:30:26,922 --> 01:30:28,688
I'm not handing out
key chains anymore.

2084
01:30:28,690 --> 01:30:29,923
No, no, no, it's got nothin'-

2085
01:30:29,925 --> 01:30:33,026
no, no, it's got nothin'
to do with key chains.

2086
01:30:33,028 --> 01:30:35,195
Look, we're gonna get fuckin'
our feet cut off

2087
01:30:35,197 --> 01:30:38,265
by this psychopath
we owe money to.

2088
01:30:38,699 --> 01:30:40,934
You guys are two huge
hollywood celebrities

2089
01:30:40,936 --> 01:30:42,436
and maybe the only people
that can fuckin' help me here

2090
01:30:42,438 --> 01:30:45,539
with what I need to do.

2091
01:30:45,541 --> 01:30:46,973
Did you say feet?

2092
01:31:02,723 --> 01:31:04,958
Now this third turn here
we're fucked.

2093
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:08,094
I'm not worried about
third fuckin' turn, man.

2094
01:31:08,096 --> 01:31:09,062
- How's your dad doin'?
- Is he ready?

2095
01:31:09,064 --> 01:31:10,964
He's all ready, man,

2096
01:31:10,966 --> 01:31:12,399
I should have got him
a swearnet suit, man.

2097
01:31:12,401 --> 01:31:14,067
- He looks great.
- He looks okay.

2098
01:31:14,069 --> 01:31:15,802
Looks like he's got a hard on.

2099
01:31:15,804 --> 01:31:17,904
Hey, just wanted to wish you
boys good luck out there today.

2100
01:31:17,906 --> 01:31:18,905
- Hey, you know what?
- Thank you very much

2101
01:31:18,907 --> 01:31:20,073
for letting us back
in the race.

2102
01:31:20,075 --> 01:31:21,641
I really appreciate it, sir.

2103
01:31:21,643 --> 01:31:23,577
Thanks so much, trigger.

2104
01:31:23,579 --> 01:31:25,579
Well, don't thank me,
thank your buddy.

2105
01:31:25,581 --> 01:31:26,913
He stepped up to the plate

2106
01:31:26,915 --> 01:31:30,984
big time for you boys,
big time.

2107
01:31:33,087 --> 01:31:34,821
What the fuck
did he mean by that?

2108
01:31:34,823 --> 01:31:35,889
I don't know.

2109
01:31:58,846 --> 01:32:01,982
How the fuck do these
things work?

2110
01:32:01,984 --> 01:32:02,949
Is jp cool with this?

2111
01:32:02,951 --> 01:32:04,017
Yes, it's fine.

2112
01:32:06,187 --> 01:32:07,821
Look, when I give
you the signal

2113
01:32:07,823 --> 01:32:09,689
pull the fuckin' thing
onto the road to block them,

2114
01:32:09,691 --> 01:32:12,025
they're gonna be pissed off
so fuck with them a bit,

2115
01:32:12,027 --> 01:32:13,126
and then get the fuck
out of the way

2116
01:32:13,128 --> 01:32:14,794
and just let them
finish the race.

2117
01:32:14,796 --> 01:32:16,963
It would've been nice
to rehearse this once.

2118
01:32:16,965 --> 01:32:18,665
Jesus christ.
Four fuckin' celebrities

2119
01:32:18,667 --> 01:32:19,633
screaming their heads off
at each other

2120
01:32:19,635 --> 01:32:20,500
caught on camera?

2121
01:32:20,502 --> 01:32:21,668
Celebrities rehearse.

2122
01:32:21,670 --> 01:32:23,637
Yeah, well, fuck.

2123
01:32:23,639 --> 01:32:26,006
Pros rehearse.
We're from hollywood.

2124
01:32:26,008 --> 01:32:27,340
Check, check, one two.

2125
01:32:27,342 --> 01:32:28,642
We rehearse in hollywood.

2126
01:32:28,644 --> 01:32:29,843
I understand
you fuckin' rehearse.

2127
01:32:29,845 --> 01:32:31,845
We don't have time to rehearse.

2128
01:32:31,847 --> 01:32:34,648
Pros rehearse. Pros rehearse.

2129
01:32:34,650 --> 01:32:35,515
We're from hollywood.

2130
01:32:35,517 --> 01:32:37,317
It's working.

2131
01:32:37,319 --> 01:32:39,986
They're probably right, man.

2132
01:32:39,988 --> 01:32:41,488
That's fuckin' rehearsal
right there, dude.

2133
01:32:41,490 --> 01:32:42,389
- Check it out.
- See it?

2134
01:32:42,391 --> 01:32:43,690
I saw it. Yes, it's...

2135
01:32:43,692 --> 01:32:45,559
Just like that, see?

2136
01:32:45,561 --> 01:32:47,227
Yeah, but can you fuckin' focus
on what we're doin' here?

2137
01:32:47,229 --> 01:32:49,162
Pull the fuckin' truck out
and block them.

2138
01:32:49,164 --> 01:32:50,997
We get one shot at this,
make it real,

2139
01:32:50,999 --> 01:32:52,832
fuck with them. Swearman.

2140
01:32:52,834 --> 01:32:54,935
All right, let's go, let's go.

2141
01:32:57,906 --> 01:33:01,374
<i>Fuckin' go, man!</i>

2142
01:33:01,376 --> 01:33:02,676
<i>There's that cocky little slut</i>
<i>in the fuckin' yellow car!</i>

2143
01:33:02,678 --> 01:33:03,543
<i>Let's catch him!</i>

2144
01:33:05,414 --> 01:33:06,680
<i>Yeah, punch it, punch it!</i>

2145
01:33:06,682 --> 01:33:08,682
<i>Fuckheads!</i>

2146
01:33:08,684 --> 01:33:10,684
Right on, man!

2147
01:33:10,686 --> 01:33:12,252
<i>That's the lead car!</i>

2148
01:33:12,254 --> 01:33:13,353
<i>We pass him we're in first</i>
<i>fuckin' place!</i>

2149
01:33:13,355 --> 01:33:15,355
<i>He's ours, buddy.</i>

2150
01:33:15,357 --> 01:33:17,023
<i>Nice, take him on the outside!</i>
<i>Take him on the outside!</i>

2151
01:33:17,025 --> 01:33:18,258
<i>He's blockin' me!</i>
<i>He's blockin' me!</i>

2152
01:33:18,260 --> 01:33:19,693
<i>Then take him on the inside!</i>

2153
01:33:19,695 --> 01:33:20,894
<i>Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!</i>

2154
01:33:20,896 --> 01:33:22,529
<i>First place!</i>
<i>First fuckin' place!</i>

2155
01:33:22,531 --> 01:33:23,763
Woo!

2156
01:33:23,765 --> 01:33:25,532
Way to fuckin' drive it, man!

2157
01:33:25,534 --> 01:33:27,100
How do you like that, dad?

2158
01:33:29,870 --> 01:33:32,372
- Squirrel.

2159
01:33:32,374 --> 01:33:33,406
Smith, you can't fuckin'
do this!

2160
01:33:33,408 --> 01:33:34,774
This is fuckin' crazy!

2161
01:33:34,776 --> 01:33:36,576
I've got no fuckin' choice!

2162
01:33:36,578 --> 01:33:38,044
We have to sell subscriptions

2163
01:33:38,046 --> 01:33:39,546
or we're all gettin'
our fucking feet cut off,

2164
01:33:39,548 --> 01:33:42,449
you included!

2165
01:33:42,451 --> 01:33:43,583
Jamie said that if they win
the sponsors'll get on board!

2166
01:33:43,585 --> 01:33:45,051
Surely to fuck
that's enough money

2167
01:33:45,053 --> 01:33:47,587
to pay that pinchbeck guy
the fuck off!

2168
01:33:47,589 --> 01:33:49,222
Maybe! I don't fuckin' know,

2169
01:33:49,224 --> 01:33:51,591
but this is gonna guarantee it
if they don't win!

2170
01:33:51,593 --> 01:33:53,727
I'm sorry.
Guys, get into character.

2171
01:33:53,729 --> 01:33:54,894
<i>It's almost show time.</i>

2172
01:33:54,896 --> 01:33:56,229
Pull that. Pull the horn.

2173
01:33:58,066 --> 01:33:59,766
- Now we're in character.
- How's that, huh?

2174
01:33:59,768 --> 01:34:02,068
Now we're in character,
mother fucker!

2175
01:34:02,070 --> 01:34:03,637
You fuckin' listen to me, smith,
they're fuckin' winning!

2176
01:34:03,639 --> 01:34:05,605
Pat, I don't have time
for this!

2177
01:34:05,607 --> 01:34:06,740
You better make
the fuckin' time,

2178
01:34:06,742 --> 01:34:08,475
'cause if you fuck this up

2179
01:34:08,477 --> 01:34:10,777
you're gonna lose
those guys forever!

2180
01:34:10,779 --> 01:34:12,145
Swearman needs
his fuckin' friends!

2181
01:34:17,318 --> 01:34:19,819
All right, man,
calm the fuck down.

2182
01:34:19,821 --> 01:34:21,921
You're right.
You're totally right.

2183
01:34:21,923 --> 01:34:24,124
Guys, forget it.

2184
01:34:24,126 --> 01:34:25,959
We're goin' down
to the finish line.

2185
01:34:25,961 --> 01:34:28,662
When we made "freddy got
fingered" we rehearsed.

2186
01:34:28,664 --> 01:34:29,929
Carrot top that was a
good-you were in that?

2187
01:34:29,931 --> 01:34:31,097
Yeah, I made-I directed that.

2188
01:34:31,099 --> 01:34:32,832
I directed that
and I required rehearsal.

2189
01:34:32,834 --> 01:34:34,100
We're going to the finish line.

2190
01:34:34,102 --> 01:34:35,835
Fuckin' forget the whole thing!

2191
01:34:35,837 --> 01:34:37,637
What'd you say?

2192
01:34:37,639 --> 01:34:39,105
- What'd you say?
- I said we're-

2193
01:34:39,107 --> 01:34:40,840
no, I said we're-
what'd you say?

2194
01:34:40,842 --> 01:34:43,610
Repeat. Repeat. Repeat.

2195
01:34:43,612 --> 01:34:44,778
Take your finger off
the fuckin' button,

2196
01:34:44,780 --> 01:34:46,046
you dumbass!

2197
01:35:01,996 --> 01:35:03,697
Hairpin right at 200 metres!

2198
01:35:04,665 --> 01:35:06,032
100 metres! Hairpin right!

2199
01:35:07,468 --> 01:35:08,802
Good job, buddy!

2200
01:35:08,804 --> 01:35:10,503
Straight shoot across
the bridge to the finish!

2201
01:35:10,505 --> 01:35:11,705
Right on, man!

2202
01:35:11,707 --> 01:35:13,039
- Punch up!
- Woo!

2203
01:35:14,642 --> 01:35:16,003
- Here they come!
- Here they come!

2204
01:35:17,212 --> 01:35:18,878
- Axel fuck!
- It got it!

2205
01:35:21,817 --> 01:35:22,882
Okay, go! Go!

2206
01:35:22,884 --> 01:35:24,044
What the fuck are you doin'?!

2207
01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:27,487
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

2208
01:35:35,997 --> 01:35:38,231
Uh oh, big fuck up.

2209
01:35:38,233 --> 01:35:40,834
Oh, my fuckin' god!

2210
01:35:43,071 --> 01:35:44,838
What the fuck was that?!

2211
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:46,339
They're okay, buddy,
they're okay.

2212
01:35:46,341 --> 01:35:47,907
Fire that up. Follow the puck.

2213
01:35:47,909 --> 01:35:49,876
Are you fuckin' serious?!

2214
01:35:49,878 --> 01:35:51,511
<i>If we don't shoot this</i>
<i>we've got fuckin' nothin'!</i>

2215
01:35:51,513 --> 01:35:54,013
Get shootin'!

2216
01:35:54,015 --> 01:35:55,014
I didn't hear him say cut.

2217
01:35:55,016 --> 01:35:56,082
Fuck yeah, let's do it!

2218
01:35:57,218 --> 01:35:58,518
Stupid fucktards!

2219
01:35:58,520 --> 01:35:59,853
There's a fuckin' race
going on!

2220
01:36:01,089 --> 01:36:02,255
Yeah, we were winnin'
for fuck sakes!

2221
01:36:02,257 --> 01:36:03,223
Tom, I'm a big fan.

2222
01:36:03,225 --> 01:36:04,505
I don't want to fuckin'
hurt you.

2223
01:36:04,926 --> 01:36:06,993
Shoulda had a rehearsal, man!

2224
01:36:08,362 --> 01:36:10,196
Holy shit,
you fuckin' connected!

2225
01:36:10,198 --> 01:36:11,865
You're fuckin' dead!

2226
01:36:11,867 --> 01:36:12,866
Are we playing
or is this for real?!

2227
01:36:12,868 --> 01:36:14,934
Oh this is for real, ginger!

2228
01:36:14,936 --> 01:36:18,204
- Not the hair!

2229
01:36:18,206 --> 01:36:20,573
Fuck, you want to play, swayze,

2230
01:36:22,544 --> 01:36:24,744
You fuckin' pussy!

Huh?

01:36:33,287 --> 01:36:34,354
Oh, you fucker!

2233
01:36:36,724 --> 01:36:38,892
This is a real fuckin' fight
between tom green, carrot top,

2234
01:36:38,894 --> 01:36:40,393
rob wells and
john paul tremblay!

2235
01:36:40,395 --> 01:36:41,895
This is the kind of shit
you'll see on swearnet. Com.

2236
01:36:41,897 --> 01:36:43,463
Five bucks a month!

2237
01:36:43,465 --> 01:36:44,597
- Fuck you!
- Come on, motherfucker!

2238

You want to fuck with me?!

2241

Fuckin' bitch slap.

What the fuck?!

01:37:11,125 --> 01:37:13,259
Die, you fucker!

2245

This is jp's dad,

01:37:17,265 --> 01:37:25,265
- I'm gonna kill you! Kill you!

2247
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:27,507
Fuck!

2248
01:37:28,108 --> 01:37:29,175
<i>Jesus christ!</i>

2249
01:37:30,177 --> 01:37:31,277
Mike, will you yell fuckin' cut

01:37:31,279 --> 01:37:33,780
before someone gets
fuckin' killed!

2251
01:37:33,782 --> 01:37:35,048
Smith set this up?!

2252
01:37:35,950 --> 01:37:37,417
Smith!

2253
01:37:38,786 --> 01:37:40,420
<i>You motherfucker!</i>

2254
01:37:41,121 --> 01:37:43,022
Jape, this wasn't supposed
to go down like this, man.

2255
01:37:43,024 --> 01:37:44,290
I swear to fuck!

2256
01:37:44,292 --> 01:37:45,658
Bull fuckin' shit!

I can't fuckin' believe

01:37:46,962 --> 01:37:48,161
We coulda fuckin' died!

2259
01:37:48,163 --> 01:37:49,696
You weren't supposed to crash!

2260
01:37:49,698 --> 01:37:52,298
I called the fuckin's thing off
and they pulled out anyway!

2261
01:37:52,300 --> 01:37:54,968
Fuckin' bullshit!

2262
01:37:54,970 --> 01:37:57,704
I didn't want you
to lose the race, man.

2263
01:37:57,706 --> 01:37:59,138
I just thought I could
get us out of this situation

2264
01:37:59,140 --> 01:38:02,041
with pinchbeck
in case you guy's lost.

2265
01:38:02,043 --> 01:38:04,310
I just thought I could
create a spectacle.

2266
01:38:04,312 --> 01:38:05,478
You're fucked!

2267
01:38:05,480 --> 01:38:06,646
What the fuck are you doin'?

2268
01:38:06,648 --> 01:38:08,514
Is this fuckin'
spectacle enough?!

2269
01:38:08,516 --> 01:38:10,216
Put the fuckin' rock down!

2270
01:38:10,218 --> 01:38:11,484
Jape, don't do that, man!

2271
01:38:11,486 --> 01:38:13,486
You never gave a fuck about us!

2272
01:38:13,488 --> 01:38:14,554
That's a big rock.

2273
01:38:15,990 --> 01:38:17,824
Where was that when I need it?

2274
01:38:17,826 --> 01:38:19,692
All you care about is fuckin'
swearnet and yourself, man!

2275
01:38:19,694 --> 01:38:21,060
Put the fuckin' rock down, man.

<i>Put the fuckin' rock down!</i>

01:38:23,498 --> 01:38:25,198
- Jape! Jape!

2279
01:38:25,200 --> 01:38:26,866
<i>Jape, he fuckin' cares</i>

01:38:28,169 --> 01:38:29,903
Pat, no, man, don't! Pat!

<i>He's gotta see this!</i>

01:38:31,206 --> 01:38:33,006
I'm gonna fuckin' show him!
Fuck off!

<i>Everything's contents smith.</i>

<i>You do it everyday!</i>

<i>Oh fuck!</i>

2305
01:39:16,784 --> 01:39:19,852
You took a load in the face
for me?

2306
01:39:20,888 --> 01:39:22,555
<i>For the love of fuck, smith.</i>

2307
01:39:22,557 --> 01:39:23,790
I had no fuckin' choice.

2308
01:39:23,792 --> 01:39:25,391
That's how I got you back
in the race.

2309
01:39:25,393 --> 01:39:28,061
<i>You jerked off an old man?</i>

2310
01:39:28,063 --> 01:39:29,629
I jerked him off for you.

2311
01:39:31,231 --> 01:39:32,966
I jerked him off for him, man.

2312
01:39:35,402 --> 01:39:36,970
He fuckin' shot a load at me,
man.

2313
01:39:36,972 --> 01:39:37,937
Do you know what that's like?

2314
01:39:37,939 --> 01:39:40,139
I do. It's fuckin' horrible.

2315
01:39:41,976 --> 01:39:45,078
I'm sorry I fuckin'
hit you so hard, man.

<i>You guys are fucked!</i>

2317
01:39:48,149 --> 01:39:50,416
But this has been fantastic.
Thanks for havin' us.

Seriously.

2319

Jape, come here, man.

2320
01:39:54,089 --> 01:39:55,088
Oh damn,

2321
01:39:55,090 --> 01:39:56,622
That always sucks.

2322
01:39:56,624 --> 01:39:58,825
Look, man,
you may not be able to win,

2323
01:39:58,827 --> 01:40:02,261
but that's the finish line
right there.

2324
01:40:02,263 --> 01:40:05,465
Come on, man, take your dad,
cross that motherfucker

2325
01:40:05,467 --> 01:40:09,135
so that I didn't just jerk off
a man for no reason.

2326
01:40:09,137 --> 01:40:10,603
- Come on, man, we can do this.
- Let's make this fucker proud!

2327
01:40:10,605 --> 01:40:12,638
Let's do it!

2328
01:40:12,640 --> 01:40:15,441
Pat, fire that fuckin'
thing up!

2329
01:40:15,443 --> 01:40:17,403
This is our viral video!
This is fuckin' swearnet!

2330
01:40:23,283 --> 01:40:25,118
This was a weird day.

2331
01:40:25,120 --> 01:40:27,453
No shit.

2332
01:40:27,455 --> 01:40:29,856
He did take a load to the face.

2333
01:40:29,858 --> 01:40:30,757
Fuck.

2334
01:41:46,201 --> 01:41:47,600
You fuckin' did it, man.

2335
01:41:49,603 --> 01:41:53,439
Very impressive business model
indeed, mr. Smith.

2336
01:41:53,441 --> 01:41:55,441
One that lets you
all retain your feet.

2337
01:42:06,887 --> 01:42:08,221
Yeah!

2338
01:42:08,223 --> 01:42:09,722
We did it, dad!

2339
01:42:12,727 --> 01:42:14,293
We did it! We did it!

2340
01:42:14,295 --> 01:42:15,495
We did it, babe!

2341
01:42:22,637 --> 01:42:24,437
Don't move your fuckin' legs,
man, they're fucked!

2342
01:42:24,439 --> 01:42:27,073
I can't feel my fuckin' legs!

2343
01:42:33,314 --> 01:42:35,114
<i>Walk it off, buddy!</i>

2344
01:42:35,116 --> 01:42:38,584
<i>Don't be a pussy!</i>
<i>Get up! You can do it!</i>

2345
01:42:47,128 --> 01:42:49,162
Thanks for watching, everybody,
I hope you enjoyed it...

2346
01:42:49,164 --> 01:42:53,332
No-no-no-no sit the fuck down. Get the
fuck back in your seats, you idiots.

2347
01:42:53,334 --> 01:42:55,334
The movie's over, smith, you
can stop being an asshole now.

2348
01:42:55,336 --> 01:42:59,005
The movie's not fuckin' over,
the credits are on.

2349
01:42:59,007 --> 01:43:01,841
We don't have to call them a
fuckin' idiots. I mean, they

2350
01:43:01,843 --> 01:43:03,776
see the credits, they probably wanna leave
and go have a drink or smoke a joint.

2351
01:43:03,778 --> 01:43:05,645
But the movie's not fuckin'
over. Why the fuck would you

2352
01:43:05,647 --> 01:43:08,114
get up and leave after
payin' fuckin' money?

2353
01:43:08,116 --> 01:43:12,118
Who watches the fuckin' there's more
shit coming up, for fuck sakes.

2354
01:43:12,120 --> 01:43:14,120
You know, it's a good
point, it's not 1995, I mean,

2355
01:43:14,122 --> 01:43:16,289
people are being a little dumb
here. Dumb here.

2356
01:43:16,291 --> 01:43:18,547
You fuckin' put things
in the credits. That's

2357
01:43:18,573 --> 01:43:20,459
what people do now,
it's the standard.

2358
01:43:20,461 --> 01:43:22,695
- Oh, that's real cool man.
- Fuckin' original idea...

2359
01:43:22,697 --> 01:43:25,198
Ah, fuckin' blow me
you fuckin' asshole.

2360
01:43:25,200 --> 01:43:28,000
Why don't you suck my
cock smith, you fuckin' dick

2361
01:43:28,002 --> 01:43:29,869
- fuck you!
- When's this comin' on?

2362
01:43:29,871 --> 01:43:31,637
It's comin' on shut the fuck up

2363
01:43:31,639 --> 01:43:33,639
I'm the fuck outta here me too

2364
01:43:33,641 --> 01:43:36,042
oh my... fuck!

2365
01:43:40,314 --> 01:43:42,181
I don't know boys, do you
think maybe we're low balling

2366
01:43:42,183 --> 01:43:44,517
them on this contract? I mean
don't these guys carry guns?

2367
01:43:44,519 --> 01:43:46,852
We're not low balling them.
Eighty-five grand a year

2368
01:43:46,854 --> 01:43:49,322
is more money then they'll
know what to do with.

2369
01:43:49,324 --> 01:43:51,524
Even if we have to go to a
hundred thousand dollars

2370
01:43:51,526 --> 01:43:53,826
who gives a fuck?
- Yeah I guess.

2371
01:43:56,698 --> 01:44:00,333
Oh look at the big, rich, fancy
fuckin' room, I'm so impressed.

2372
01:44:00,335 --> 01:44:02,235
Ricky, fuck off!

2373
01:44:02,237 --> 01:44:03,736
Have a seat boys.

2374
01:44:03,738 --> 01:44:05,338
Just 'cuz you guys think
you own me doesn't mean

2375
01:44:05,340 --> 01:44:07,173
you can fuckin' boss me
around tell me to sit down.

2376
01:44:07,175 --> 01:44:10,376
Ricky they're trying to be nice to
us, just sit the fuck down, okay?

2377
01:44:10,378 --> 01:44:13,346
Yeah guys look, thanks for coming in.
We don't want there to be

2378
01:44:13,348 --> 01:44:16,249
any weirdness here, I mean we bought
you off your-your last owners

2379
01:44:16,251 --> 01:44:19,352
and we're hoping we can work
something out to have the cameras

2380
01:44:19,354 --> 01:44:22,021
follow you around again,
take a look.

2381
01:44:22,023 --> 01:44:24,257
I'll take that. I'm in
charge of my own fucking

2382
01:44:24,259 --> 01:44:26,592
destination from now on.

2383
01:44:26,594 --> 01:44:28,427
So this is a straight up
money offer or what kind of

2384
01:44:28,429 --> 01:44:30,396
fucking perks are we
talkin' about here?

2385
01:44:30,398 --> 01:44:32,365
It's a good point
julian. Yes gentlemen,

2386
01:44:32,367 --> 01:44:37,203
what are the perks of the deal?

2387
01:44:37,205 --> 01:44:39,905
Actually there's some really
fucking cool perks guys.

2388
01:44:39,907 --> 01:44:43,376
Julian you're a heavy drinker,
how'd you feel about

2389
01:44:43,378 --> 01:44:46,245
being the spokesman for "liquorman's
old dirty canadian whiskey"?

2390
01:44:46,247 --> 01:44:48,247
All the free whiskey
you can drink.

2391
01:44:48,249 --> 01:44:49,715
Whoa!

2392
01:44:49,717 --> 01:44:51,617
What?

2393
01:44:51,619 --> 01:44:54,387
I'm a bit of a rum man but if the
whiskey's free fuck it, I'll try it out.

2394
01:44:54,389 --> 01:44:58,090
That's a fucking great perk for
julian but I was actually more

2395
01:44:58,092 --> 01:45:02,595
interested in how bubbles would be
benefiting in the perks department.

2396
01:45:02,597 --> 01:45:04,397
Well bubbles I heard you were
a tequila man, is that true?

2397
01:45:04,399 --> 01:45:08,301
Ah fuck I'll suck an ape cock for
a fuckin' nice snap of tequila.

2398
01:45:08,303 --> 01:45:12,438
Well how would you like to be the
spokesperson for "bald pussy tequila"?

2399
01:45:12,440 --> 01:45:15,379
What? Holy fuck boys!
It's my favourite kind!

2400
01:45:15,405 --> 01:45:17,743
The one with the
kitty on the label.

2401
01:45:17,745 --> 01:45:18,778
Right on bubs!

2402
01:45:21,616 --> 01:45:22,915
Spokesman!!

2403
01:45:22,917 --> 01:45:24,784
Well what about fucking me?
Anything for me?

2404
01:45:24,786 --> 01:45:27,620
We know you're a heavy smoker so we
set up a deal with "50 cigarettes"

2405
01:45:27,622 --> 01:45:30,289
for you to be the
international spokesman.

2406
01:45:30,291 --> 01:45:32,091
Free cigarettes, bud.

2407
01:45:32,093 --> 01:45:35,461
No fuckin' way!!! I love these
short little fuckin' things.

2408
01:45:35,463 --> 01:45:38,297
It feels like there's almost
twice as many in a pack!

2409
01:45:38,299 --> 01:45:41,834
Well there is, there's
fifty of them.

2410
01:45:41,836 --> 01:45:44,170
Well look this is all fine
and candy but seriously

2411
01:45:44,172 --> 01:45:47,273
where the fuck is the part in
here that tells us how much

2412
01:45:47,275 --> 01:45:50,443
we're going to get paid to let those
camera dicks follow us around again, huh?

2413
01:45:50,445 --> 01:45:56,349
It's ah right on the last page, the
big bold number there with the zeros.

2414
01:46:00,620 --> 01:46:03,622
Eight-five hundred dollars?

2415
01:46:03,624 --> 01:46:05,124
No it's...

2416
01:46:05,126 --> 01:46:06,125
Done done

2417
01:46:06,127 --> 01:46:06,959
give me this.

2418
01:46:06,961 --> 01:46:08,294
No, no, no, no, no, no!!

2419
01:46:08,296 --> 01:46:10,129
Ricky what the fuck?

2420
01:46:10,131 --> 01:46:13,132
No I know how this fucking game works.
What do you think I am, stupid?

2421
01:46:13,134 --> 01:46:15,801
Ricky do not
fuckin' blow this!!

2422
01:46:15,803 --> 01:46:18,337
I'm not going to fucking blow this.
These dicks are willing to pay

2423
01:46:18,339 --> 01:46:23,476
eighty-five hundred bucks,
you'll pay nine grand.

2424
01:46:23,478 --> 01:46:27,380
Hmm, eighty-five
hundred's fine.

2425
01:46:31,318 --> 01:46:36,322
Ah fuck, you drive a hard bargain
ricky but ah nine grand...

2426
01:46:36,324 --> 01:46:40,526
I think we could-I think we could
push it to nine grand boys.

2427
01:46:40,528 --> 01:46:43,662
Yes, yes! See that's how you
fucking negotialate boys.

2428
01:46:43,664 --> 01:46:47,032
Hahahaha! Holy fuck!

2429
01:46:47,034 --> 01:46:48,501
Nice work boys.

2430
01:46:48,503 --> 01:46:49,502
Thanks a lot fellas.

2431
01:46:49,504 --> 01:46:51,871
Cheers guys.

2432
01:46:51,873 --> 01:46:54,707
Boys, holy fuck those guys are
stupid. Nine fucking grand!!

2433
01:46:54,709 --> 01:47:00,413

2434
01:47:01,348 --> 01:47:03,382
Holy fuck those guys are
stupid. Nine grand.

2435
01:47:03,384 --> 01:47:08,020
Nine grand!

2436
01:47:08,022 --> 01:47:10,589
Wow

01:47:11,525 --> 01:47:13,025

2438
01:47:13,027 --> 01:47:14,927
Yes boys, yes!

01:47:14,929 --> 01:47:16,729
My balls are bouncing!

2440
01:47:16,731 --> 01:47:18,531
Boys that seemed too
fucking easy!

2441
01:47:18,533 --> 01:47:21,066
That's some good fucking money. I
think we should sell smoke every...

2442
01:47:21,068 --> 01:47:23,736
I never had this much
money in my life.

2443
01:47:23,738 --> 01:47:25,571
Let's smoke a
celebratorytation...

2444
01:47:25,573 --> 01:47:26,572
Who the fuck are you guys?

2445
01:47:26,574 --> 01:47:27,440
What the fuck?

2446
01:47:27,442 --> 01:47:28,407
Swearnet crew.

2447
01:47:28,409 --> 01:47:30,042
What?

2448
01:47:30,044 --> 01:47:31,544
Well we just got word you
guys signed that contract.

2449
01:47:31,546 --> 01:47:33,212
We're-we're here to follow ya.

2450
01:47:33,214 --> 01:47:34,713
Yeah we signed a fucking contract,
what do you mean you're here to

2451
01:47:34,715 --> 01:47:38,451
follow us now?! I thought we
were shooting a tv series.

2452
01:47:38,453 --> 01:47:40,119
Signed it to make a tv
show, didn't we?

2453
01:47:40,121 --> 01:47:41,720
No, no it says 24 hours a
day, 7 days a week boys.

2454
01:47:41,722 --> 01:47:44,890
Ricky what did the fucking
thing say? Did you not read?

2455
01:47:44,892 --> 01:47:46,559
Are you fucking kidding me?

2456
01:47:46,561 --> 01:47:47,726
I didn't really read it. You guys
grabbed it out of my fucking hand,

2457
01:47:47,728 --> 01:47:49,128
eighty-five hundred bucks,
done, done.

2458
01:47:49,130 --> 01:47:50,229
You grabbed it from my
fucking hands!!

2459
01:47:50,231 --> 01:47:52,097
Ricky this is...

2460
01:47:52,099 --> 01:47:52,565
This is fucking...
You guys aren't

around 24 hours...

2462
01:47:53,100 --> 01:47:54,400
Would you let go of me.

2463
01:47:54,402 --> 01:47:55,234
Ricky, ricky!!

2464
01:47:58,905 --> 01:48:00,806
Oh fuck ricky, you
knocked him out!

2465
01:48:00,808 --> 01:48:02,408
Nice going rick.

2466
01:48:02,410 --> 01:48:04,910
Oh fuck. Well boys I can't be
followed around 24 hours day.

2467
01:48:04,912 --> 01:48:06,645
This is fucking bullshit!

2468
01:48:06,647 --> 01:48:08,080
Well you shouldn't have
fucking signed

2469
01:48:08,082 --> 01:48:09,648
